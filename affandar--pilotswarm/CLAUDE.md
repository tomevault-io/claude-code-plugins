## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/pilotswarm/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

# Copilot Instructions for PilotSwarm

## Agent Smith naming

The published `agent-manager` package and agent display as **Agent Smith**.
Keep the stable `agent-manager` IDs, FQNs, file paths, capability gates, and
provider/session configuration unchanged when updating the display name.
Existing system sessions named Agent Manager use the same display alias.

## Chat call previews

Portal tool and cross-agent calls use compact, collapsible first-line previews.
Correlate execution and external-tool events by their call/request IDs within
the durable session; completion updates the existing row. Keep bulk history,
live append, and backward paging consistent, and preserve disclosure identity.
Render raw arguments/results as text. Empty-response diagnostics remain only
in Activity; do not turn them back into chat warnings. The TUI keeps calls in
its Activity view.

## **⚠️ NEVER commit, push, or deploy without explicit user permission. ALWAYS ask first.**

> **MANDATORY:** Do NOT run `git commit`, `git push`, `git tag`, deploy scripts, or any
> operation that modifies the repository history or remote state without the user
> explicitly saying "commit", "push", or "deploy". Stage files and describe what
> you'd commit, then ask.

## Repo Scope Boundary

When the user asks for changes, releases, or deploys in this repository, operate on `pilotswarm` only unless they explicitly ask to update a downstream consumer as well.

- Do **not** propagate PilotSwarm changes into downstream app repos or vendored SDK mirrors by default.
- Do **not** deploy downstream projects as part of a PilotSwarm deploy unless the user explicitly asks for that separate rollout.
- If a downstream project is out of sync, call it out clearly instead of silently patching it.

## Bug Report Anonymization

When writing or updating files under `docs/bugreports/`, keep downstream deployments anonymous by default.

- Do **not** include downstream app names, customer/project names, proprietary agent names, cluster/context names, namespaces, hostnames, URLs, endpoints, email addresses, or other deployment-specific identifiers unless the user explicitly asks to preserve them.
- Replace live identifiers with clear placeholders such as `<downstream-app>`, `<cluster-context>`, `<namespace>`, `<session-id>`, or generic labels like "downstream app" / "named-agent session".
- Avoid pasting raw production session IDs, pod names, or copied prompt content that would reveal a downstream app's identity when a summarized or redacted example is sufficient.
- Before committing bug-report docs, scan them for identity leaks and redact anything that is not required to explain the bug.

## Sensitive Local Files

**Do NOT modify `.model_providers.json`, `.env`, or `.env.remote` without the user explicitly asking.** The real `.model_providers.json` is a local gitignored config file that may contain personal service URLs, while `.env` / `.env.remote` hold credentials. Never read env files to extract secrets, never commit the real `.model_providers.json`, and never overwrite local config with placeholder content unless the user asked for that exact reset.

When env or model-catalog shape changes, keep `.env.example` and
`.model_providers.example.json` in sync with placeholder values. The catalog is
provider-type/model metadata only. Named shared/personal providers,
credentials, defaults, limits, allowances, and holds are runtime CMS state;
do not add new live credentials or `defaultModel` routing to checked-in
catalogs. Env-backed catalog credentials remain bootstrap compatibility only.

AKS Dockerfiles copy the explicit checked-in deploy catalog, never the private
gitignored `.model_providers.json`. Verify the type catalog inside running
worker/portal images plus the viewer-scoped runtime `listModels()` surface.
Provider/budget schema changes follow the normal stored-procedure migration
rules and must keep management client, Web API, MCP, TUI/portal, docs, and tests
in parity.

`.env` and `.env.horizondb` are two **standalone** local configs, never layered. `.env` is stock-PostgreSQL only: it backs the default `./scripts/run-tests.sh` run (all suites with the PG fact store) and must leave the HorizonDB enhanced-facts/graph settings empty. `.env.horizondb` is a complete standalone config (stock PG runtime storage + HorizonDB enhanced facts/graph) used by `./scripts/run-tests.sh --with-horizondb` and the Horizon Harvester scripts. Those paths load **only** `.env.horizondb` — there is **no fallback to `.env`, ever** — so every value the run needs (`DATABASE_URL`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, model keys, `HORIZON_*`) must be duplicated in it. Keep `.env.horizondb.example` in sync with its shape, like `.env.example`.

## Project Overview

pilotswarm is a durable execution runtime for [GitHub Copilot SDK](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk) agents, powered by [duroxide](https://github.com/microsoft/duroxide) (a Rust-based durable orchestration engine). It provides **crash recovery, durable timers, session dehydration, and multi-node scaling**.

## Architecture

The runtime separates into two runtime components:

- **`PilotSwarmClient`** — manages sessions, sends prompts, subscribes to events. Lightweight, no GitHub token needed. Only handles serializable data.
- **`PilotSwarmWorker`** — runs LLM turns, executes tool handlers, manages the Copilot runtime. Requires a GitHub token. Tools are registered here.

Both connect to the same PostgreSQL (or SQLite) database. The orchestration layer (duroxide) coordinates between them.

### Key Data Flow

```
Client → duroxide orchestration → SessionProxy activity → SessionManager → ManagedSession → CopilotSession (Copilot SDK)
```

### Tool Registration

Tools contain handler functions (non-serializable). Two registration patterns:

1. **Worker-level registry** (`worker.registerTools([...])`) — tools available to all sessions. Clients reference by `toolNames: ["name"]` (serializable strings).
2. **Per-session** (`worker.setSessionConfig(id, { tools })`) — same-process mode only.

Tools are re-registered on the `CopilotSession` via `registerTools()` at every `runTurn()` call in `ManagedSession`.

## Coding Conventions

- **TypeScript** for all source in `src/`. Tests and examples are plain `.js` (ESM).
- **ESM modules** — all imports use `.js` extensions (`from "./types.js"`).
- **duroxide is CommonJS** — use `createRequire(import.meta.url)` for duroxide imports.
- Internal classes/functions marked `@internal` are not part of the public API.
- Orchestration functions are generator functions (`function*`) that yield duroxide primitives.
- `ManagedSession.runTurn()` uses `send()` + `on()` internally, never `sendAndWait()`.

## Orchestration Determinism Rules

Orchestration generator functions are **replayed from the beginning** on every new event. The generator must produce the exact same sequence of yielded actions during replay as during original execution. Violating this causes `nondeterministic: custom status mismatch` errors.

### NEVER use in orchestration code:
- **`Date.now()`** — returns different values during replay. Use `yield ctx.utcNow()` instead.
- **`Math.random()`** — non-deterministic. Use `yield ctx.newGuid()` for unique IDs.
- **`crypto.randomUUID()`** — same issue, use `yield ctx.newGuid()`.
- **`setTimeout` / `setInterval`** — use `yield ctx.scheduleTimer(ms)` instead.
- **Any I/O or network call** — wrap in an activity.
- **Conditional yields based on wall-clock time** — the branch may differ during replay.

### ALWAYS use:
- `yield ctx.utcNow()` — deterministic timestamp (replay-safe)
- `yield ctx.newGuid()` — deterministic GUID
- `yield ctx.scheduleTimer(ms)` — durable timer
- `yield session.someActivity()` — durable activity
- `ctx.setCustomStatus(json)` — fire-and-forget (no yield), but order relative to yields matters

### Key principle:
Anything that **changes the sequence of `yield` statements** must itself be deterministic. Branching on non-deterministic values (like `Date.now()`) before a yield is the most common bug. `setCustomStatus()` is recorded in history — if the orchestration yields an activity where replay expects a `CustomStatusUpdated` (or vice versa), duroxide throws a nondeterminism error.

### Deployment note:
Changing the orchestration code (adding/removing/reordering yields) requires a new version. Freeze the released handler in `orchestration_<version>/`, open the next version in `orchestration/`, and keep both registered so in-flight sessions replay against their original yield sequence while new sessions use the latest version. Do not reset durable state solely for an orchestration upgrade; a reset is reserved for an explicitly approved destructive operation.

### Docker / AKS Build Convention

The AKS cluster runs on AMD64 Linux nodes. **All Docker image builds must use `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64`** — not plain `docker build` — because development happens on macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon). Without the platform flag, the pushed image has the wrong architecture and pods fail with `ImagePullBackOff` / `no match for platform in manifest`.

Both `deploy-aks.sh` and `reset-local.sh remote` build and push images. Any script that builds Docker images for AKS must use `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64`.

Checked-in instructions must never hard-code a cluster/context name, namespace, DNS label, or other deployment-specific identifier. Resolve the Kubernetes context and namespace from `.env.remote` via `K8S_CONTEXT` and `K8S_NAMESPACE` before running AKS deploy or reset commands.

## TUI Boundary Rule

The TUI (`packages/app/tui/`) must interact with PilotSwarm **exclusively through the public `PilotSwarmClient`, `PilotSwarmWorker`, and management APIs**. It must never import or call internal runtime modules (`session-manager.ts`, `managed-session.ts`, `cms.ts`, `session-proxy.ts`, `orchestration.ts`, etc.) directly. The only exception is logging/diagnostics (for example reading duroxide trace logs for display). If the TUI needs new data or capabilities, expose them through the client/worker API surface first.

## Portal Boundary Rule

The portal (`packages/app/web/`) must interact with PilotSwarm **exclusively through the public `PilotSwarmClient`, `PilotSwarmWorker`, `PilotSwarmManagementClient`, and the CLI's `PortalRuntime` API**. It must never import or call internal SDK modules (`session-manager.ts`, `managed-session.ts`, `cms.ts`, `session-proxy.ts`, `orchestration.ts`, etc.) directly.

Portal auth is provider-based (`packages/app/web/auth/`). Auth providers live in `auth/providers/`, token normalization in `auth/normalize/`, and authorization policy in `auth/authz/engine.js`. Configuration uses **canonical env vars only**: `PORTAL_AUTH_*` and `PORTAL_AUTHZ_*` — never legacy `ENTRA_*` aliases.

## Client Layering Rule — direct vs Web API

Every feature surface goes through the SDK clients, and the **client** is the
only thing that knows which mode it is in:

- **Direct mode** — `new PilotSwarmClient({ store })` /
  `new PilotSwarmManagementClient({ store })` talk to PostgreSQL and the other
  providers directly. This mode is for a **trusted subsystem**: the worker, and
  the portal/Web API server process itself.
- **Web API mode** — the *same* constructors, given `{ apiUrl }`, return the web
  variants (the `isWebOptions()` dispatch in `client.ts` and
  `management-client.ts`) and talk to `/api/v1`. The Web API server then runs the
  client in **direct mode inside its own trusted subsystem**. Web mode is the
  supported public mode.

Rules, in order:

1. **Never reach past the client.** No feature surface may construct
   `PgSessionCatalog`, a fact store, or any other provider on its own. The only
   legitimate direct-store consumers are the SDK itself and the direct-mode
   transport whose whole job is to *be* direct mode.
2. **The CLI is layered entirely on the client and defaults to Web API mode.** A
   CLI gesture must never require `DATABASE_URL` to talk to a deployment.
   `--store` may exist as an explicit operator escape hatch; it must not be the
   only path.
3. **A new management operation lands on `PilotSwarmManagementClient` first**,
   then the Web API route, then MCP / CLI / portal on top of that. An operation
   that exists only as an HTTP route, or only in direct mode, is incomplete.
4. Methods with no web equivalent throw `webModeUnsupported(...)` rather than
   silently degrading.

Known violations to fix rather than copy:

- `packages/app/tui/src/agents-cli.js` (`pilotswarm agents`) breaks (1) and (2):
  it constructs `PgSessionCatalog` directly and has no Web API mode, so it needs
  database credentials and bypasses the Web API's creator-or-admin authz.
- Agent packages break (3): ten Web API routes with **zero**
  `PilotSwarmManagementClient` methods behind them.
- No layer exposes a package **artifact download**; the tarball is reachable
  only file-by-file through the tree/file routes.

### TUI Keybindings

If you add or change a TUI keybinding, you must update all user-facing keybinding surfaces together:

- the actual binding in host input handling
- the contextual status hints that mention that key
- prompt placeholder or prompt-affordance copy when send/newline behavior changes
- modal, footer, detail, or inline pane-title copy that references that key
- the startup keybinding hint/splash content or help dialog/modal content, if that host has them

Do not change a TUI keybinding in code without keeping those surfaces in sync.

Current overlap to preserve unless intentionally changed:

- `n` fast-starts a generic session with the default model when generic sessions are allowed; if generic sessions are disabled, it falls back to the model-first creation flow when models are available, or the agent picker
- `Shift+N` opens the model picker, then reasoning effort when applicable, then the generic/named-agent picker
- Agent picker availability comes from `transport.listCreatableAgents()` / portal `/api/bootstrap.creatableAgents`. In remote mode, if `session-policy.json.creation.bundledAgents` opts into SDK-bundled agents such as `generic-crawler`, the CLI transport must expand those names from `packages/sdk/plugins/default-agents/`; worker logs alone are not enough to prove the TUI/portal picker can show them.
- `f` in the sessions pane opens the session owner filter
- `Ctrl+G` in the sessions pane opens the move-to-group picker for the selected top-level non-system sessions, or for the active top-level non-system session when multi-select is off
- `t` in the sessions pane opens the rename-title dialog
- `P` in the sessions pane pins or unpins the active top-level session (system sessions, child sub-agent sessions, and sessions contained in a group cannot be pinned; if a pinned session is moved into a group its pin is dropped automatically)
- `v` in the sessions pane cycles an owned non-system session tree through private, shared-read, and shared-write visibility; `Shift+S` opens targeted user sharing. The portal exposes equivalent selected-session controls. Keep lowercase `v`, uppercase `S`, and uppercase `V` (multi-select) distinct.
- `V` in the sessions pane toggles multi-select; `Space` toggles selection on the active row; `c` cancels, `d` completes, and `D` hard-deletes the selected non-system non-group sessions in one confirmation; `Ctrl+G` moves selected top-level non-system sessions to a group; `Esc` exits select mode. The portal `Terminate (n)` action opens the three-disposition picker for Complete, Cancel, and Hard Delete.
- `t` in the logs inspector toggles log tailing
- `s` in the chat pane toggles between the transcript and the current session summary view
- `Ctrl+A` in the prompt opens the attach-file dialog
- `x` in the files inspector deletes the selected artifact after confirmation
- `o` in the files inspector opens the selected file in the OS default app
- `f` in the logs inspector opens the log-filter dialog, `f` in the files inspector opens the files-filter dialog, and `f` in the stats inspector cycles between session, fleet, and users views
- `Shift+A` opens or closes the Admin Console; in My Providers, `e` adds a personal provider and `Shift+U` updates the selected provider credential in place. The portal exposes the same action as `Update Key`. Keep credential drafts masked and clear them before awaiting the request; `r` refreshes and `Esc` returns to the workspace.

## TUI Maintenance

The shared terminal UI is a maintained product surface, not an experiment.

The native TUI and the browser portal are a single shared UX surface by default. When a change affects shared behavior, layout semantics, inspector behavior, themes, keybindings, prompt ergonomics, or visible help text, keep the TUI and portal in complete sync unless that is genuinely impossible or the user explicitly asks for a divergence.

If a change leaves the TUI and portal out of sync, say so explicitly in your response and note the reason for the mismatch rather than implying parity.

When you change the terminal/shared UI stack in:

- `packages/app/ui/core/`
- `packages/app/ui/react/`
- `packages/app/tui/`
- `packages/app/web/`
- `run.sh`

you must also keep [`.github/skills/pilotswarm-tui/SKILL.md`](./skills/pilotswarm-tui/SKILL.md) current if the change affects architecture, layout, visual conventions, status semantics, prompt/question behavior, message-card behavior, or keybinding expectations.

For the native TUI files inspector, keep the standard outer inspector shell as the top-level pane chrome. Do not reintroduce a second files-specific top-level shell around the tab body.

Pane headers in the shared UI should stay compact. Keep title text data plain; the portal may use a slim card header, while the TUI should render pane titles without a highlighted header background. When a pane narrows, prefer dropping low-priority title metadata such as session ids or recent-window labels before squeezing content.

Session rows should show interval cron as `[cron <duration>]` and wall-clock cron as `[cron <next client-local time>]`; do not expose the internal `cron_at` tool name in row badges. The sequence and activity panes should render wall-clock `cron_at` lifecycle events with the same visible `cron` label and magenta styling as interval cron, including a visible wake-up indicator when `session.cron_at_fired` arrives.

Session row status icons should avoid rapid flicker: when a row's visual status changes, keep rendering the previous icon/color until the new row visual status has stayed stable for at least 5 seconds.

Cross-session `[SESSION_MESSAGE ...]` and `[SESSION_MESSAGE_RESPONSE ...]` protocol prompts are product-visible transcript items. Render them as dedicated session request/reply cards in the shared chat transcript, not collapsed activity-only system notices.

Named-agent session titles should be displayed with the user-assigned title or uniquifier first, then the agent type, then the agent/persona metadata (for example `M61 Conductor · R2D Train Watcher · Mad-Eye Moody`). Keep this ordering consistent in session rows and chat pane headers so narrow/mobile views expose the useful title first.

Portal `?session=<id>` deep links are explicit navigation. The linked session must become the active, visibly highlighted Sessions row, with ancestors expanded and a transient filter exception when current filters exclude it; prior empty-space deselection must not hide the highlight.

The portal diagnostics column's vertical Inspector/Activity divider must allow either pane to reach zero height so the other fully covers the column, while leaving the divider visible for restoration.

System sessions render with the machinery marker `⚙` in yellow. Leave one text space after the marker in title-bearing rows/headers; the terminal renderer already gives this symbol enough visual width.

System session actions are restart actions. Done prompts for `Complete & Restart`, Cancel prompts for `Terminate & Restart`, and Delete prompts for `Hard Delete & Restart`; all route through `restartSystemSession`. In the portal Sessions pane, the ordinary `Terminate` button becomes `Restart` for system sessions and opens a disposition picker with those three restart choices.

Session groups are shared TUI/portal pure-container rows, not fake agent sessions and not bulk-operation sessions. Render them as top-level `🗂` rows that can be pinned independently and open a group details view instead of a chat transcript. Session ordering bands are: system sessions first, pinned groups, pinned single sessions, unpinned groups, then unpinned sessions. On fresh page/app load, seed the stable row order inside each band and inside groups from session last-updated time, most recent first; after that, preserve the stable row order during live refreshes so timestamp updates do not churn the visible list. Sessions inside a group are not pinnable; child rows sort by the stable order alone. The timestamp shown at the end of a session row is the session's last-updated time, rendered in the client's local timezone via `formatDisplayDateTime` (no hard-coded zone). When no stored selection/expansion config exists, default to the main PilotSwarm system session selected and all groups/parent sessions collapsed; persist exact `activeSessionId` and `collapsedSessionIds` in portal `users.profile_settings` and native TUI user config. Leave two text spaces after the marker so terminal renderers do not crowd the title. Sessions move into or out of groups through the move-to-group picker (`[New Group]`, existing groups, `[No Group]`). Groups are private per-user organization: the catalog returns only the viewer's own groups, session rows carry the viewer's own placement (`viewerGroupId` on the wire), placement requires only read access to the session (mixed-owner selections are allowed and every one of the viewer's groups is offered), and organizing a session never changes what any other viewer sees. When a group is selected, inspector and activity panes should show a generic prompt to select a session for details. Group cancel/complete actions are not available; group deletion clears only the viewer's placements (sessions are untouched), so non-empty groups delete cleanly.

Use the `pilotswarm-tui` agent/skill for TUI-specific work. Treat it as the canonical short-form memory for the current TUI design choices and maintenance preferences.

## Builder Agent Templates

This repo ships distributable builder-agent templates under `templates/builder-agents/`.

These are **not** active repo-local agents for this workspace. They are copyable templates intended to be installed into a user's repository under `.github/agents/` and `.github/skills/`.

If you add or change PilotSwarm features that affect app builders, keep the following in sync:

- `templates/builder-agents/agents/*.agent.md`
- `templates/builder-agents/skills/**/SKILL.md`
- `templates/builder-agents/README.md`
- [docs/developer/building/builder-agents.md](../docs/developer/building/builder-agents.md)
- the builder-facing CLI/SDK docs those templates reference

Treat these templates as a maintained product surface. Do not leave them stale when builder-relevant behavior changes.

## Agent Versioning

Authored PilotSwarm `.agent.md` files use explicit frontmatter versioning:

```yaml
schemaVersion: 1
version: 1.0.0
```

Use the `agent-versioning` skill when creating or editing agent prompts, embedded agents, or builder templates that generate agents. PilotSwarm-authored agents and templates use SemVer for `version`; app authors may use any non-empty string, but SemVer is recommended.

When you change a PilotSwarm-authored `.agent.md` prompt, tool expectation, workflow guidance, frontmatter metadata, output contract, or child-contract guidance, bump its `version` appropriately:

- patch for wording clarifications or typo fixes that should not materially change behavior
- minor for new capabilities, tools, examples, or backwards-compatible workflow guidance
- major for changed role semantics, removed expectations, or incompatible output/contract changes

When changing builder templates that create or edit app agents, update both the template agents and their skills so generated app `.agent.md` files include `schemaVersion: 1` by default and a `version`, and so edits to existing agent files bump the version string according to the app's chosen versioning style. Use `schemaVersion: 3` only when the agent declares `initialRequiredTool`; that tool must also appear in `tools`. Use `schemaVersion: 4` for exact per-profile `nativeTaskTools` allowlists; see `docs/developer/native-task-tools.md` for the parent-permission and durable-tool boundaries.

## Significant Feature Rollouts

When you add or materially change a user-facing or builder-facing feature, update the surrounding surfaces in the same change whenever they are affected:

- the canonical docs in `docs/` for the relevant SDK, CLI, plugin, or packaging behavior
- the DevOps sample in `examples/devops-command-center/`
- the Horizon Harvester sample in `examples/horizon-harvester/` (see its dedicated section below)
- the builder templates in `templates/builder-agents/`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` if the change affects contributor workflow or maintenance expectations
- package names, install examples, and CI publish/release wiring if the npm surface changes

Do not treat proposal docs as sufficient once behavior ships. If the product changed, the canonical docs, sample app, and builder templates should reflect it too.

## Horizon Harvester Sample

`examples/horizon-harvester/` is the maintained worked example for the optional
EnhancedFactStore + knowledge-graph providers (`@pilotswarm/horizon-store`). Treat it as
a product surface, not a throwaway demo — keep it current when harvester, facts, graph,
or embedder behavior changes.

It ships three repo-root entry-point scripts; all three must keep working:

- `scripts/run-horizon-harvester-sample.sh` — harvest, delete/reconcile, and/or ask (`HARVESTER_SCENARIO=full|harvest|delete|ask`)
- `scripts/export-horizon-harvester-graph.sh` — export the graph to a Markdown/Mermaid file (`examples/horizon-harvester/scripts/graph-to-mermaid.mjs`)
- `scripts/clean-horizon-harvester-sample.sh` — clean up; `--facts` / `--drop` escalate to HorizonDB teardown (`examples/horizon-harvester/scripts/cleanup-local-db.js`)

When you change harvester-relevant behavior, keep these in sync in the same change:

- the sample agents `plugin/agents/source-harvester.agent.md` (`crawler: true`) and `plugin/agents/librarian.agent.md` (reader), bumping each agent's `version` per the `agent-versioning` skill
- the three scripts above and the sample `README.md` (Run / Visualize / Cleanup sections)
- the builder skill `templates/builder-agents/skills/pilotswarm-knowledge-harvester/SKILL.md` and `docs/developer/deploy/harvester.md`, which teach the same patterns

Load-bearing conventions to preserve:

- **Harvester scripts load `.env.horizondb` only.** All three repo-root scripts source the standalone `.env.horizondb` (stock PG runtime + HorizonDB facts/graph) via `node --env-file`, with no fallback to `.env`. Every value they need (`DATABASE_URL`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `HORIZON_*`) must be present there.
- **Namespaces are not interchangeable.** The harvester writes raw source captures under its own `corpus/*` namespace; `intake/*` is the system Facts Manager's curation queue for short task-agent observations. Never route harvester documents through `intake/*`.
- **Crawl receipts are `{ scopeKey, etag }`.** Harvesters must pass both values from `facts_read_uncrawled` into `facts_set_crawled({ scopeKeys: [{ scopeKey, etag }] })`. A skipped mark means the fact changed after it was read, was already marked, or no longer exists; re-read before declaring the backlog drained. `facts_set_crawled({ keyPrefix, crawled:false })` is for deliberate prefix recrawl; do not use coarse prefix writes to reconcile tombstones.
- **Deleted crawl rows reconcile graph evidence.** A row with `deletedAt` set is a tombstone, not source content to rebuild. Call `graph_remove_evidence(scopeKey, namespace)` for that row before marking it crawled so only that source fact's graph anchors/evidence are removed.
- **Embedder/search text wiring.** `HORIZON_EMBED_*` (in `.env.horizondb`) configures the durable in-DB embed loop; without it the `embedding` column stays NULL and `facts_similar` returns nothing. The embed input is `key + value::text` (horizon-store migration `0007`), and lexical `search_text` uses the same broad `key + value::text` source (migration `0009`), so any JSON value shape remains embeddable and lexically searchable.
- **The durable embed loop survives a schema drop.** Any teardown must cancel it first (the `--drop` path does); never leave a stale loop running against a dropped schema.

## Agent Prompt Tuning & Model Compatibility

When you change an agent prompt, tune timer interrupt wording, or test a new LLM model with PilotSwarm agents, update both:

- **`/memories/repo/agent-tuning-log.md`** — Copilot repo memory (read by the `pilotswarm-agent-tuner` agent)
- **`docs/agent-tuning-log.md`** — version-controlled copy for human reference

Record: the model tested, which agent type, observed behavior, expected behavior, and whether the change worked. Keep the model compatibility matrix current. Use the `pilotswarm-agent-tuner` agent for structured tuning workflows.

## Observability Surface for the Agent Tuner

The `agent-tuner` agent is the canonical investigator for reliability, cost,
performance, and correctness issues. Any new monitoring signal, metric,
aggregate, or diagnostic that is useful for those investigations **must
be reachable by the tuner through a tool**, not just through SQL or a dashboard.

When you add or change an observability surface, follow this checklist:

1. **Persist the signal durably.** Either as a column on
   `session_metric_summaries`, a row in `session_events` (preferred for
   per-event signals), or a counter in the relevant store schema (CMS or
   facts).
2. **Expose it through `PilotSwarmManagementClient`.** A typed read
   method on the management client is the canonical API surface — no
   tuner-only side channels, no raw SQL helpers in scripts.
3. **Wrap it as a tuner inspect-tool.** Add a `read_*` tool in
   [`packages/sdk/src/inspect-tools.ts`](../packages/sdk/src/inspect-tools.ts)
   inside the `if (!isTuner) return [readAgentEventsTool];` guard so it
   is registered only on tuner sessions. Mirror the existing patterns:
   `read_session_*` for per-session, `read_session_tree_*` for spawn
   trees, `read_fleet_*` for fleet-wide.
4. **Surface it in the TUI/portal stats pane** if it is operator-grade.
   Selectors live in [`packages/app/ui/core/src/selectors.js`](../packages/app/ui/core/src/selectors.js)
   and render in both the native TUI and the portal automatically.
5. **Test it.** A `*-stats.test.js` (or similar) under `test/local/` that
   seeds data and verifies the management API + the inspect-tool
   handler.

Examples already in the codebase to follow:

- `getSessionMetricSummary` / `read_session_metric_summary` (tokens,
  snapshot, hydration counters)
- `getSessionTreeStats` / `read_session_tree_stats` (spawn-tree roll-up)
- `getFleetStats` / `read_fleet_stats` (fleet-wide aggregates)
- `getSessionSkillUsage` / `read_session_skill_usage` (static + learned
  skill consumption)
- `getFleetSkillUsage` / `read_fleet_skill_usage` (skill usage across
  the fleet)
- Cache-hit ratio fields on every stats surface
  ([`computeCacheHitRatio`](../packages/sdk/src/cms.ts))

If a new signal is **not** wired through these layers, the tuner cannot
reason about it during incident investigations, and operators have to
fall back to ad-hoc SQL — which is the exact gap this rule exists to
prevent.

## Duroxide Bugs

When a bug is identified as originating in **duroxide** (the Rust-based durable orchestration runtime), do NOT attempt to work around it in the runtime or TUI layer. Instead:

1. Clearly explain the bug and its root cause in duroxide.
2. Insist on fixing the issue in the duroxide codebase itself.
3. Only implement a workaround if explicitly asked to by the user.

Duroxide is the foundational runtime — papering over its bugs at higher layers creates fragile, hard-to-maintain code.

For live runtime forensics — tracing orchestration/activity logs, session-affined `runTurn` placement, hydration/dehydration evidence, or crash-vs-affinity investigations — use [`.github/skills/investigate-duroxide-runtime/SKILL.md`](./skills/investigate-duroxide-runtime/SKILL.md).

## Testing

### Running Tests

The local integration test suite requires a running PostgreSQL database and a GitHub token (in `.env`). Tests use **vitest** as the test runner with `describe`/`it` from `vitest`.

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh              # run all suites in parallel (default)
./scripts/run-tests.sh --parallel   # run all suites in parallel explicitly
./scripts/run-tests.sh --sequential # run all suites sequentially
./scripts/run-tests.sh --suite=smoke  # run only matching suite(s)
```

Individual suites can also be run directly:
```bash
cd packages/sdk
npx vitest run test/local/smoke-basic.test.js
npx vitest run test/local/smoke-basic.test.js -t "Send And Receive"  # filter by test name
```

### Test Suite Structure

Tests are organized by level in `packages/sdk/test/local/`:

| Level | File(s) | What it covers |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | `smoke-basic.test.js`, `smoke-api.test.js` | Basic session create/send/receive, CMS state, session info API |
| 2 | `durability.test.js` | Durable timers, orchestration replay |
| 3 | `multi-worker.test.js` | Worker restart, session handoff, multi-node |
| 4 | `commands-user.test.js` | Commands and events through orchestration |
| 4b | `management.test.js` | Management client: sendMessage, renameSession, cancelSession, session ops |
| 5 | `sub-agents/*.test.js` | Sub-agent spawning (custom, named, multiple), child metadata, model override, nested spawning (depth 2+), check_agents |
| 6 | `kv-transport.test.js` | KV-based response transport |
| 7 | `cms-events.test.js`, `cms-state.test.js` | CMS event consistency, state transitions, title rename, soft delete |
| 8 | `contracts.test.js` | API contract validation |
| 9 | `chaos.test.js` | Chaos/fault injection scenarios |
| 10 | `session-policy-guards.test.js`, `session-policy-behavior.test.js` | Session creation policy guards and behavior |
| — | `model-selection.test.js` | Model selection (explicit, default, multi-model), CMS model column |
| — | `reliability-crash.test.js`, `reliability-multi-crash.test.js` | Crash recovery, multi-crash scenarios |
| — | `system-agents.test.js` | PilotSwarm/Sweeper/ResourceMgr auto-start lifecycle |

Tests use a `withClient()` helper that spins up a co-located worker + client pair. Each test creates fresh sessions with isolated database schemas.

### Pre-Deploy Gate

**The deploy script (`./scripts/deploy-aks.sh`) runs the full test suite automatically before deploying.** If any suite fails, the deploy aborts. To skip (not recommended): `--skip-tests`.

### Updating the Test Suite

When adding a new feature, add or update tests following these rules:

1. **New tool or activity** → add a test in the appropriate level (usually L1 smoke or L5 sub-agents). Verify the tool is callable by the LLM and produces correct CMS state.

2. **New orchestration behavior** → add tests in L2 (durability) or L3 (multi-worker) depending on whether the behavior involves replay, timers, or worker handoff.

3. **New agent or agent parameter** → add a test in L5 (`sub-agents.test.js`) that spawns the agent and verifies CMS metadata (agentId, title, isSystem, splash, parent link). See `testSpawnNamedAgents` as the template.

4. **New CMS fields or state transitions** → add assertions in L7 (`cms-consistency.test.js`).

5. **Changed tool schema** → if you modify a tool's parameters (especially `spawn_agent`, `wait`, `ask_user`), verify both the stub schema (in `subAgentToolDefs()`) and the real handler schema (in `runTurn()`) are in sync. The "Spawn Named Agents" test catches stub/handler schema mismatches.

6. **New orchestration version** → freeze the current `orchestration.ts` to `orchestration_X_Y_Z.ts`, register in `orchestration-registry.ts`, then run the full suite. Multi-worker and chaos tests will catch replay/versioning issues.

7. **New test suite file** → add it to both the `SUITES` array in `scripts/run-tests.sh` and the `test:local` npm script in `packages/sdk/package.json`. Every test file in `test/local/` must be runnable via `./scripts/run-tests.sh`. Orphaned test files that only run manually are not acceptable.

Each test function should:
- Use `withClient(env, ...)` for setup/teardown
- Use assertion helpers from `test/helpers/assertions.js`
- Use `describe`/`it` from `vitest` (not `node:test`)
- Log key values with `console.log("  ...")` for debuggability

### Test Integrity Rules

**No retries.** Never add `retry` to test configurations (vitest `retry`, `retries`, or manual retry loops). If a test fails, it means the product has a bug or the test prompt is wrong — fix the root cause.

**No hacks.** Do not paper over product bugs by weakening assertions, adding arbitrary sleeps, or swallowing errors. Tests exist to catch real problems.

**Preserve test throughput by default.** Do not reduce concurrency, file parallelism, worker counts, pool caps, or other test-throughput settings without first checking with the user and giving a strong, specific reason. Prefer fixing connection pressure or backend instability at the client/server capacity layer rather than silently serializing tests.

**Never reduce test parallelism without explicit user consent.** Do not convert `describe.concurrent` to serial, serialize concurrent `it` cases, lower vitest pool/worker caps, or otherwise make tests run one-at-a-time inside the test files or config without the user explicitly approving that specific change in the current conversation. Multiple LLM-driven tests can run in parallel comfortably; do NOT assume the model backend can't handle concurrency. If a parallel run times out or flakes, investigate the real cause (capacity, connection pressure, a product bug) instead of serializing. It is fine to run cases one at a time during your own local validation, but the committed tests must stay parallel unless the user says otherwise.

**Default-model by default.** Tests should use the repo's configured default model unless the test is explicitly about model selection, multi-model behavior, cross-model behavior, or an intentional per-model compatibility sweep. Do not pin a specific model in ordinary behavior tests just to make them pass.

**No custom system prompts to compensate for product behavior.** Tests should use `client.createSession()` without overriding `systemMessage` unless the test is specifically testing custom system messages. The default agent prompt and tool schemas should be sufficient for the LLM to use tools correctly. If the LLM isn't calling a tool, that's a product bug in the default prompt or tool schema — fix it there, not in the test.

**Raise failures loudly.** When a test fails, investigate and report the root cause. Do not silence it. Flag the issue to the user.

## Database Schema & Stored Procedures

All PostgreSQL data access (reads and writes) in the CMS and Facts stores goes through **stored procedures**. No inline SQL in TypeScript — the provider methods call `SELECT schema.proc_name(...)`.

### Migration System

Both CMS (`copilot_sessions` schema) and Facts (`pilotswarm_facts` schema) use the same versioned migration runner (`pg-migrator.ts`) with PostgreSQL advisory locks for concurrent worker safety. Migrations are defined as TypeScript functions in `cms-migrations.ts` and `facts-migrations.ts`, applied automatically on `initialize()`.

### Schema Change Rules

1. **Never edit a previous migration.** Add a new one with `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`.
2. **Every migration needs a companion diff file** (`packages/sdk/src/migrations/NNNN_diff.md`). Git diffs for SQL-in-TypeScript only show new code, not the delta from the previous version. The diff file makes stored procedure changes reviewable.
3. **All new data-access queries must be stored procedures.** No new inline SQL in the provider classes.
4. **Migration SQL must be idempotent** — `IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE OR REPLACE`, etc.

Use the [`schema-migration` skill](./skills/schema-migration/SKILL.md) for the full step-by-step process.

## Common Patterns

### Adding a new activity
1. Define the activity function in `session-proxy.ts` → `registerActivities()`
2. Create a proxy function in `createSessionProxy()` or `createSessionManagerProxy()`
3. Call it from the orchestration generator in `orchestration.ts`

### Updating duroxide-node (npm) Dependency

When a new version of `duroxide` is published to npm (after the Node.js SDK is updated and published):

1. **Update package.json**: Run `npm update duroxide` or manually bump the version in `package.json`
2. **Check for API changes**: If the duroxide SDK added new `OrchestrationContext` methods, `Runtime` options, or `Client` APIs, update usage in:
   - `src/orchestration.ts` — orchestration generator function
   - `src/session-proxy.ts` — activity definitions
   - `src/worker.ts` — runtime initialization
3. **Build**: `npm run build` (TypeScript compilation)
4. **Test**: `npm test`
5. **Verify examples**: Run `node examples/chat.js` to smoke test

> ⚠️ **Never push without explicit user permission**

### Updating Copilot SDK (`@github/copilot`, `@github/copilot-sdk`)

When asked to update Copilot SDK dependencies, update **both** `@github/copilot-sdk` and `@github/copilot` together. Do not bump only one package: the SDK's permission protocol, built-in tools, and generated RPC schemas must stay aligned with the bundled Copilot CLI package. After updating, verify `packages/sdk/package.json` and `package-lock.json` resolve compatible versions of both packages.

Pin both dependencies exactly in the published SDK manifest, not only the workspace lockfile. SDK 1.0.13 bundles its own platform runtime (CLI 1.0.83); verify `getStatus().version` from a fresh tarball install on the target platform. Do not omit optional platform dependencies. Route production client creation through `src/copilot-client.ts`: its explicit stdio connection preserves process/environment isolation, and its OpenAI/Azure completions-only `snippy` workaround must never reach native GitHub Copilot or Anthropic clients. The durable client pool separates those transports even for the same credential.

Run `./scripts/run-tests.sh --all-providers`, including `copilot-provider-compatibility` (real SDK/CLI, synthetic model endpoints), and the separate credentialed `test/live-copilot-providers.mjs` gate for available model providers. Storage-provider phases are not model-provider coverage. Record missing live credentials explicitly; do not claim synthetic Anthropic WIF exchanges validate real identity federation. See [the 1.0.13 migration record](../docs/developer/contributing/copilot-sdk-migration-1.0.13.md) for commands, boundaries and the removal criterion for the shim.

When a new version of the Copilot SDK is pulled in, run the tool-collision regression check **before** rolling the new version to production:

```bash
cd packages/sdk
npx vitest run test/local/tool-name-collisions.test.js
```

The Copilot SDK ships built-in tools through `cli.toolInit` (e.g. `bash`, `create`, `edit`, `task`, `list_agents` in 1.0.32+). It rejects any external tool whose name shadows a built-in unless that tool sets `overridesBuiltInTool: true`. Each new SDK release may add more built-ins.

When the regression test fails:

1. **Identify the new collision** — the assertion message names the colliding PilotSwarm tool(s).
2. **Decide rename vs. override**:
   - **Rename to `ps_<name>`** when PilotSwarm's tool has different semantics from the SDK's. This is the default. Update the live `orchestration.ts`, `managed-session.ts` tool descriptions, agent prompts under `packages/sdk/plugins/`, builder templates under `templates/builder-agents/`, the DevOps sample under `examples/devops-command-center/`, and the docs under `docs/`. **Do not modify frozen `orchestration_1_0_*.ts` files** — those are pinned to historical versions per the duroxide orchestration versioning skill.
   - **Set `overridesBuiltInTool: true`** when PilotSwarm's tool deliberately replaces the SDK's (e.g. `wait`, `ask_user` — durable-orchestration versions of the SDK primitives). Add a comment explaining why the override is intentional.
3. **Update `SDK_BUILT_IN_TOOL_NAMES`** in `test/local/tool-name-collisions.test.js` to include any newly-discovered SDK built-in names so future regressions stay caught.
4. **Re-run the test until it passes**, then run the full suite via `./scripts/run-tests.sh` before deploy.

### Adding a new command
1. Add the command case in the orchestration's cmd dispatch (`orchestration.ts`)
2. Add corresponding handling in `client.ts` `_waitForTurnResult()` if needed

### Adding a new event type
1. Fire it from `ManagedSession` via the `onEvent` callback
2. Persist it in CMS via `session-proxy.ts` event capture
3. Filter it in `PilotSwarmSession.on()` if it needs special handling


## Personal MoA dashboards

The browser's MoA profile is version 3 (`activeDashboardId`, up to five
`dashboards`). Each dashboard owns its split tree, desktop aspect ratio and
focused panel. Normalize legacy profiles through `ui/core/src/moa.js`; preserve
intentional empty layouts. Drafts belong to sessions and stay in browser memory.
Switching dashboards must not terminate sessions or redirect a send, including
when an attachment upload finishes after its view unmounts.

Header tabs must collapse to the dashboard picker based on available width;
never shrink or overlap action icons. Mobile uses that picker with proportional
layout previews. Keep panel swipes and Tab cycling scoped to the active dashboard.
Migration 0076 protects saved version-3 layouts against stale single-dashboard
profile writes; do not remove that guard during UI or profile refactors.

MoA dashboard order is profile data; cached views and transcripts remain client
memory only. Refresh controllers only for the visible dashboard and guard late
loads against session or dashboard switches. Desktop supports tab dragging;
mobile keeps a triangle-only dashboard picker in the session header. Keep Stop
visible for a running focused session. Use X for closing a panel and reserve
trash for deleting a session. Chat follows new content only at the bottom, and
session-focus changes center the corresponding session-list row.
