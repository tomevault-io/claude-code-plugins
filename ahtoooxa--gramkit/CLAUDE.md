# Common Issues and Solutions

## Docker Issues

- **Problem**: Docker containers failing to start
  **Solution**: Check logs with `docker-compose logs` and ensure all required environment variables are set

- **Problem**: Frontend hot reload not working
  **Solution**: Ensure volumes are correctly mounted in docker-compose.local.yml

- **Problem**: Backend database connection issues
  **Solution**: Verify database container is running and credentials are correct

## Frontend Development

  **Solution**: Use `cd frontend && yarn lint --fix` to apply automatic fixes

## Backend Development

- **Problem**: Database migrations failing
  **Solution**: Check migration history and ensure proper sequencing

- **Problem**: API endpoint returning 500 errors
  **Solution**: Check backend logs for exceptions and verify input validation

## Testing

- **Problem**: Tests failing in CI/CD pipeline
