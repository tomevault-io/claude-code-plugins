# Development Workflow

This project follows specific development practices to ensure code quality.

## Local Development

1. Use the local Docker setup with: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up`
2. Hot reload is enabled in development mode
3. For frontend-only development, you can run: `cd frontend && yarn dev`
4. For backend-only development:
   - Set up Python virtual environment
   - Install dependencies: `cd backend && pip install -e .`
   - Run the development server

## Code Standards

- Frontend follows ESLint and Prettier configurations
  - [frontend/.eslintrc.cjs](mdc:frontend/.eslintrc.cjs)
  - [frontend/.prettierrc.json](mdc:frontend/.prettierrc.json)
- Backend follows PEP 8 with additional project-specific rules
- Pre-commit hooks enforce code standards
  - [.pre-commit-config.yaml](mdc:.pre-commit-config.yaml)

## Version Control

- Use feature branches for new work
- Create pull requests for code reviews
- Version bumping is handled by the script: [bump_version.py](mdc:bump_version.py)

## Tarot App-Specific Conventions

- Keep tarot-specific logic isolated in dedicated services
- Use consistent naming for tarot card entities
- Follow the established data models for readings and interpretations
