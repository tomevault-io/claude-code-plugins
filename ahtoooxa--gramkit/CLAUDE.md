# Backend Services Architecture

The backend follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Service Layer

- [backend/src/app/services/](mdc:backend/src/app/services) - Business logic services
- Services should be focused on specific domain functionality
- Use dependency injection for external dependencies
- Keep services testable and independent

## Data Models

- [backend/src/app/schemas/](mdc:backend/src/app/schemas) - Pydantic models for validation and serialization
- Input validation models should be prefixed with "Create" or "Update"
- Response models should represent the exact API response structure

## Database Access

- [backend/src/app/infrastructure/](mdc:backend/src/app/infrastructure) - Database access and external integrations
- Use SQLAlchemy for ORM
- Define clear repository interfaces
- Keep SQL queries in repository classes

## API Structure

- APIs should follow RESTful principles
- Use appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
- Document APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Validate all input data with Pydantic models

# Backend Services Structure

The backend services layer follows a structured approach:

1. Each service extends `BaseService` which provides common infrastructure
2. Services are organized by domain (users, subscriptions, messages, etc.)
3. Services contain business logic and orchestrate between repositories and external systems

## Repository Layer

The repository layer provides data access:

1. Each repository extends `BaseRepo` which provides common CRUD methods:
   - `get_by_id`: Get entity by primary key
   - `get_all`: Get all entities
   - `create`: Create a new entity
   - `update`: Update an existing entity
   - `delete`: Delete an entity
   - `upsert`: Insert or update an entity based on conflict keys

2. Only implement custom repository methods for specialized queries that aren't covered by BaseRepo

3. Keep repository methods focused on data access only (no business logic)

## Service Layer Responsibilities

Services are responsible for:

1. Business logic implementation
2. Validation and error handling
3. Orchestrating between multiple repositories
4. Integrating with external systems
5. Event dispatching
6. Monitoring and logging

## Dependency Injection

Services and repositories use dependency injection:

1. Services receive repositories and other dependencies in their constructor
2. This facilitates testing and loose coupling
3. The service container assembles the dependency graph
