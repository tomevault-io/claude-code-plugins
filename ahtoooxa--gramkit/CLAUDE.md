# Frontend Components Structure

The frontend follows a structured approach to organization.

## Presentation Layer

- [frontend/src/presentation/components/](mdc:frontend/src/presentation/components) - Reusable UI components
- [frontend/src/presentation/screens/](mdc:frontend/src/presentation/screens) - Page components
- [frontend/src/presentation/layouts/](mdc:frontend/src/presentation/layouts) - Layout components
- [frontend/src/presentation/assets/](mdc:frontend/src/presentation/assets) - Static assets

## Component Guidelines

1. Components should follow Single Responsibility Principle
2. Use composition with Vue 3 Composition API
3. Keep components small and focused
4. Leverage TypeScript for type safety
5. Use Tailwind CSS for styling

## State Management

- [frontend/src/store/](mdc:frontend/src/store) - Pinia stores for state management
- Use composables for reusable logic
- Keep UI and business logic separated
