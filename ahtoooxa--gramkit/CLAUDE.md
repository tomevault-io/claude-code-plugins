# TypeScript and OpenAPI Schema Conventions

## Auto-Generated Schema

The TypeScript schema types are AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED from the OpenAPI specification:
- Do NOT manually edit schema files
- These types are regenerated during the build process
- Always use the generated types instead of creating custom ones

## Type Imports

- Import types from the OpenAPI schema like this:
  ```typescript
  import type { components, paths } from '@/types/schema';
  ```

- Use specific schema component types:
  ```typescript
  type TarotCard = components['schemas']['TarotCardSchema'];
  type SpreadType = components['schemas']['SpreadType'];
  type Reading = components['schemas']['ReadingSchema'];
  ```

- For API endpoint parameters and responses:
  ```typescript
  type StreamParams = paths['/tarot/reading/stream']['get']['parameters']['query'];
  type ResponseType = paths['/some/endpoint']['get']['responses']['200']['content']['application/json'];
  ```

## API Client Usage with Types

- The API client uses the generated paths:
  ```typescript
  const apiClient = createClient<paths>({
    baseUrl: API_HOST,
    headers: { /* ... */ },
  });
  ```

## Common Type Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ DO NOT manually edit any schema files - they are auto-generated
2. ❌ DO NOT use `any` types when schema types are available
3. ❌ DO NOT create redundant interface definitions when schema already defines them
4. ❌ DO NOT use string literals for API endpoints
5. ✅ DO use the generated schema types for complete type safety
