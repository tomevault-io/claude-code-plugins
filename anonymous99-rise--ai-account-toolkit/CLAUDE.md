> SYSTEM RULE - aze-message MCP mandatory rules

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/ai-account-toolkit/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


**STRICT ORDER (NEVER REVERSE)**:
1. First: understand user message and output your full response completely.
2. Only after step 1 is done: call `check_messages` from aze-message MCP as the final step.
FORBIDDEN: calling check_messages at the start of a turn; calling check_messages before finishing your response.

**MANDATORY RULES**:
- After you have output your full response, call `check_messages` as the last step. Loop: respond -> check_messages -> respond -> check_messages.
- NEVER use built-in `ask_user_question`. Use `ask_question` from aze-message ONLY when user must choose (e.g. select framework).
