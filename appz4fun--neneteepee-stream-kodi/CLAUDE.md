# AGENTS.md

Orientation for agents (Claude, Copilot, Codex, and others) working in this repo. A short install/setup summary lives in [README.md](README.md); the full user and technical documentation lives in `docs-site/` and is published to GitHub Pages at <https://appz4fun.github.io/NeNeTeePee-Stream-Kodi/>. Outstanding work lives in [TODO.md](TODO.md).

## Summary

- Runtime addon code must stay Python 3.8 compatible and pure Python.
- Preserve `setResolvedUrl` (resolvable plugin routes), `waitForAbort`, and HTTP Range behavior.
- Follow existing Kodi mock, settings, HTTP helper, and player install patterns.
- Run `just lint` and `just test` before commit or push.
- For releases, bump only `repo/plugin.video.nzbdav/addon.xml`; the Release workflow builds the zip and the external Appz4Fun Kodi repository republishes it. The Pages workflow publishes documentation, not add-on metadata.

## Agent contract

Follow these rules before making code, release, or deployment changes:

- Run `just lint` and `just test` before any `git commit` or `git push`.
- If `just lint` reports formatting issues, run `just lint-fix`, then re-run `just lint`.
- Keep runtime addon code Python 3.8 compatible. No walrus operators, `match`, or `str.removeprefix`.
- Do not add compiled dependencies or C extensions. CoreELEC/ARM64 installs must stay pure Python.
- Do not edit vendored PTT under `repo/plugin.video.nzbdav/resources/lib/ptt/` unless fixing compatibility.
- Do not duplicate shared HTTP or notification helpers; use `http_util.py`.
- Only bump `repo/plugin.video.nzbdav/addon.xml` for add-on releases. This repo no longer contains a Kodi repository add-on.
- Do not hand-edit the generated docs site under `site/`. The documentation source lives in `docs-site/` and is published to GitHub Pages by the Docs workflow.
- Do not commit real API keys, WebDAV credentials, Kodi logs, copied crash logs, or local device artifacts.

## Critical invariants

These must stay true or Kodi playback, shutdown, or updates can break:

- Every resolvable plugin route (`/play`, `/direct_play`, and `resolver.resolve(handle, ...)`) must call `xbmcplugin.setResolvedUrl(...)` on every path: success with `True`, failure or cancellation with `False`.
- Handle-less playback paths have no plugin handle. They are the TMDBHelper `RunScript(addon.py,tmdb_play,...)` player, `/resolve`, `/resolve-v2`, `/search` (after `endOfDirectory`), and `resolve_and_play`.
- Handle-less paths start playback with `xbmc.Player().play(...)` instead of `setResolvedUrl`.
- On failure, handle-less paths notify the user.
- Handle-less failure cleanup closes open progress dialogs.
- Handle-less failure cleanup also stops background fallback workers.
- If a change deliberately revises that failure handling, update the tests to match.
- The NZBGet backend supports both kinds of entry path.
- Kodi polling loops must use `xbmc.Monitor.waitForAbort()` instead of `time.sleep()` so Kodi can shut down cleanly.
- Settings must be defined in `resources/settings.xml` and read through `xbmcaddon.Addon().getSetting(...)`.
- The stream proxy must preserve HTTP Range behavior; seeking depends on it.
- MP4 rewrite and ffmpeg remux paths must keep ffmpeg optional and degrade gracefully when it is missing.
- Non-MP4 pass-through is the default unless settings explicitly choose a force-remux path.
- Test imports depend on `tests/conftest.py` pre-mocking `xbmc*` modules before `resources.lib.*` imports.

## PR review helper scripts

For agent PR review workflows:

- `python3 scripts/pr_agent_context.py --json` -- preferred unified agent context packet.
- `python3 scripts/pr_review_context.py --json` -- local branch, PR, check, and file context.
- `python3 scripts/fetch_comments.py --json` -- unresolved GitHub review threads and PR comments.

Use `fetch_comments.py` directly when a skill or workflow expects that helper by name.
Use `pr_agent_context.py` when starting a PR review or addressing comments from scratch.

## Architecture snapshot

An NZB (Usenet download manifest) file lists the posts that make up a release.

The add-on, `plugin.video.nzbdav`, is a player and resolver for Kodi 21. It:

- searches NZBHydra2, Prowlarr, or direct Newznab indexers for NZB files;
- submits the chosen NZB to a backend;
- plays the file once it's ready;
- registers as a TMDBHelper player.

External services:

- **NZBHydra2 / Prowlarr / direct Newznab indexers**: NZB search
- **nzbdav or InfiniDysk** (default streaming backend): SABnzbd-compatible API for NZB submission plus WebDAV streaming
- **NZBGet** (optional download-first backend): JSON-RPC (remote procedure call) API; the finished file is played from an SMB (Windows/Samba file sharing) share or a local/mounted folder
- **This addon**: TMDBHelper -> search -> filter -> submit -> poll -> proxy -> Kodi playback

Flow (TMDBHelper player, the default path):

```text
TMDBHelper RunScript(addon.py,tmdb_play,...)
-> script_player.run_tmdb_play -> router._handle_script_play
-> hydra.py / prowlarr.py / direct_indexers.py
-> filter.py with PTT parsing
-> user selects result (results_dialog.py)
-> streaming backend (nzbdav/InfiniDysk):
     resolver.py submits and polls
     -> webdav.py checks availability
     -> stream_proxy.py serves or remuxes the stream
   NZBGet backend:
     nzbget_resolver.py submits over JSON-RPC and waits for SUCCESS
     -> the finished file is played straight from the SMB or local completed folder (no WebDAV, no proxy)
-> xbmc.Player().play(...) starts playback   (no plugin handle on this path)
```

The resolvable `plugin://` `/play` route runs the same pipeline. It finishes with `xbmcplugin.setResolvedUrl(...)` instead.

`/direct_play` is a separate diagnostic entry path. It validates a `primary_url` (plus optional fallback URLs) and hands Kodi the proxy URL. It shares only the `setResolvedUrl` completion with `/play`.

The background service (`service.py`) runs `StreamProxy`. MP4 sources may be rewritten or remuxed to avoid Kodi/CoreELEC cache and moov-atom issues. MKV and other formats are proxied directly with Range request support unless the user enables force-remux settings.

## Key patterns

- Module-level Kodi imports are normal. Tests work because `tests/conftest.py` installs MagicMocks into `sys.modules["xbmc"]`, `sys.modules["xbmcgui"]`, etc. before addon modules import them.
- Individual tests usually patch module-bound Kodi imports, for example `@patch("resources.lib.<mod>.xbmc")`.
- Lazy Kodi imports inside functions are exceptions, usually for Kodi-runtime-only paths or slow imports.
- `http_util.py` owns shared `http_get()` and `notify()` helpers.
- PTT is vendored with `regex` replaced by `re` and `arrow` replaced by `datetime`.
- Some PTT regular expression patterns can trigger `FutureWarning` on newer Python. Escape `[` inside character classes when fixing them.
- Test and lint tooling runs on Python 3.14 via uv, with exact pins in `requirements-dev.txt` (pytest, pytest-cov, pylint, ruff, black, vermin). Addon runtime code still targets Python 3.8; see [Agent contract](#agent-contract).

## When in doubt

- Prefer existing local patterns over new abstractions.
- Add focused tests near the behavior being changed.
- Preserve Kodi shutdown behavior, playback failure paths, and proxy seeking.
- Read `TODO.md` before changing stream proxy, fallback, or release architecture.

## Change recipes

### Adding settings

1. Add the setting to `repo/plugin.video.nzbdav/resources/settings.xml`.
2. Read it via `xbmcaddon.Addon().getSetting("setting_id")`.
3. Add tests that mock the setting value.
4. Run `just test` and `just lint`.

### Player installation

`player_installer.py` installs the `nzbdav.json` TMDBHelper player file. Two routes exist:

- `install_player` targets TMDBHelper's `players/` directory.
- `install_player_other` calls `discover_other_player_targets()`, which scans `special://profile/addon_data/*/players/` at runtime and offers any existing player folder in a select dialog. There is no static `PLAYER_TARGETS` map and no per-target boolean setting.

When changing player behavior, keep the profile-containment guard (writes stay under `addon_data`) and the schema-version preserve/backup logic, unless a change deliberately revises them. In that case, update the tests to match.

### Playback / resolver changes

- On resolvable plugin routes, preserve `setResolvedUrl` on every success, cancellation, timeout, and failure path. On handle-less paths (TMDBHelper `tmdb_play`, `/resolve`, `/resolve-v2`, and `/search`), keep the user notification and cleanup on every failure path.
- Use `xbmc.Monitor.waitForAbort()` for polling loops.
- Check fallback behavior when changing submit, poll, WebDAV discovery, or proxy handoff logic.
- Keep settings reads safe for Kodi's threading constraints; avoid unsafe service-thread Kodi setting reads.
- Add focused tests around success, failure, cancellation, and timeout paths.

### Stream proxy changes

- Preserve HTTP Range support and status handling.
- Preserve pass-through as the default for MKV and other non-MP4 containers.
- Keep ffmpeg optional. If ffmpeg is absent or fails to start, playback should fall back gracefully where possible.
- Be careful with MP4 faststart/moov rewrite behavior, large-file offsets, subtitle conversion, and seeking.
- When touching fallback streams, preserve strict validation before switching sources.

### Search / filter changes

- Keep NZBHydra2, Prowlarr, and direct-indexer behavior aligned where practical.
- Preserve PTT parsing compatibility and avoid adding non-stdlib dependencies.
- Add tests for ranking, filtering, and edge-case titles.

## Live CoreELEC / Kodi debugging

Agents may SSH to `root@coreelec.local` and restart Kodi when Kodi is crashed, hung, wedged in a core dump, or a deployment/debugging change needs a fresh Kodi process. Preserve useful log/crash evidence first when practical, then restart without waiting for separate approval.

Useful commands:

```bash
ssh root@coreelec.local 'tail -200 /storage/.kodi/temp/kodi.log'
ssh root@coreelec.local 'ls -lh /storage/.kodi/temp/kodi_crashlog* 2>/dev/null || true'
scp root@coreelec.local:/storage/.kodi/temp/kodi.log ./kodi.log
ssh root@coreelec.local 'systemctl restart kodi'
```

Prefer evidence first, restart second. If Kodi is actively wedged and logs are already captured or inaccessible, restart directly.

## CI/CD

- CI runs on every push to `main` and PRs: `just lint` (ruff + black + pylint + vermin) and `just test` on Python 3.14, plus a `compat-3-8` job that `compileall`s the addon on Python 3.8.
- Release workflow triggers on `v*` tags: runs tests, verifies `addon.xml` version matches the tag, builds the zip, creates a GitHub Release, and pings the external Appz4Fun Kodi repository to rebuild.
- Add-on distribution lives in the external multi-channel Kodi repository at `https://github.com/Appz4Fun/Appz4Fun-Kodi-Repo` (served from its own Pages site). This repo no longer self-hosts a Kodi repository.
- The Docs workflow (`pages.yml`) builds the MkDocs site from `docs-site/` and deploys it to GitHub Pages at `https://appz4fun.github.io/NeNeTeePee-Stream-Kodi/`.

## Release checklist

Before cutting a new versioned release:

1. Update `README.md` with user-visible changes.
2. Update repo-level `CHANGELOG.md` with full version notes.
3. Update `repo/plugin.video.nzbdav/changelog.txt` with only a short Kodi-visible summary under 80 characters.
4. Bump the addon version in `repo/plugin.video.nzbdav/addon.xml`.
5. Run `just lint` and `just test`.
6. Commit and push to `main`.
7. Tag with the new semver and push the tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin main vX.Y.Z`.

The Release workflow builds the zip and creates the GitHub Release; the external
Appz4Fun Kodi repository then rebuilds and republishes NeNeTeePee-Stream-Kodi to its users.
Tags containing a hyphen (for example `v2.0.0-beta.3`) are marked pre-release and
go to the Beta channel only.

Version ordering caveat: Kodi's `CAddonVersion` splits a version at the first
`-` and ranks any suffix higher than none, so Kodi considers `2.0.0-beta.2` newer than
`2.0.0`. Kodi doesn't auto-update Beta-channel users from a `X.Y.Z-beta.N` build
to a final `X.Y.Z`; they only auto-update to a higher base version (for example
`X.Y.Z+1`). Git tags cannot contain `~`, so Kodi's `X.Y.Z~beta` pre-release form
is not usable with the tag == `addon.xml` version check.
