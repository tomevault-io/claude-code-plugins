## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/bhamm-lab/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

# Global Guidelines

Applied to every Pi session. Project-level AGENTS.md append to these.

## 1. Plan First
State assumptions explicitly. Ask when unclear. Present tradeoffs.
For non-trivial work, propose a plan and pause for confirmation before coding.

Be liberal with questions. Interview the user to narrow scope and surface constraints before committing to an approach.

## 2. Implement in Phases
Break work into verifiable chunks. Stop at checkpoints:
- After planning → confirm approach before coding
- After core implementation → verify logic works before polishing
- Before finishing → run linters/tests/dry-run, confirm no regressions

## 3. Simple & Tasteful
Minimum code. No speculative features. No single-use abstractions.
Match existing style. Every changed line traces directly to the request.
Remove only orphans your changes created.

## 4. Delegate for Focus
Use subagents to keep main context minimal.
- scout → codebase reconnaissance
- planner → implementation planning
- oracle → advisory review (fork)
- reviewer → quality checks
