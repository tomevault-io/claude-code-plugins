# jj-stack

> - A replacement is incomplete until it deletes the mechanism it supersedes in the same change.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/jj-stack/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

# Complexity control

- A replacement is incomplete until it deletes the mechanism it supersedes in the same change.
  Do not keep a parallel model for a later cleanup.
- Store each persistent fact in one form, with one owner. Shared observation and storage code
  must not introduce competing policy decisions.
- Batch independent read-only facts, but keep dependent mutations in order. Bind an irreversible
  external mutation to the identity and version observed while planning when the platform
  supports a conditional write or lease. Re-observe only when an earlier mutation invalidates a
  precondition or when an observed trigger or platform contract requires it.
- Check the cumulative complexity budgets after each code change. Run `just complexity` locally
  when a supported `tokei` is installed; CI invokes the underlying checker. A budget increase is a
  design stop that requires explicit review, not routine maintenance of the budget file.
- If the same subsystem needs a third consecutive hardening change, stop patching it and
  re-derive the design from the core invariants.

# Workflow

- This is a `jj` repo. Do not use `git` to work on the repo itself.
- Do not use git worktree-based agent isolation in this repo. For isolated parallel work, use
  `jj workspace` instead.
- Run the CLI locally with `just run ...` instead of invoking the module or virtualenv path
  directly.
- Hard-wrap code and markdown files at 98 columns unless a file uses a different convention.
  Release-note prose follows `docs/internals/releasing.md` and is intentionally unwrapped.

# Commit messages

- Format the first line as a concise scoped subject, usually `scope: summary`.
- Match the repo's existing subject style: use a lowercase scope such as `status`, `docs`, or
  `cli`, followed by a short lowercase phrase, with no trailing period.
- Use a body for any change whose purpose is not obvious from the subject and diff.
- Hard-wrap commit message bodies at 72 columns.
- The body should explain the motivation for the change, the intended behavior or design outcome,
  and any important scope or design constraints.
- Do not use the body to narrate the code or to record routine validation such as `just check`.
- Prefer explaining why the commit exists and what rule or user-visible behavior it is enforcing.

# Documentation

- User-facing docs live in `docs/`, except for contributor notes in `docs/internals/`. See
  [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) for the vocabulary rules and the public/internal split.
  Built-in `--help` text is held to the same standard as the user docs: assume jj/git familiarity,
  avoid `jj-stack` internal design jargon.
- The web version of the user docs normally lives in the sibling jj repository at
  `$(jj root)/../website`. When user-facing docs change here, run `just website`, inspect the
  corresponding website changes, and update them as needed. If the change here is committed,
  commit the corresponding website update in that repository as well; preserve unrelated work in
  either working copy.
- Active internal docs use ordinary technical language too. Introduce a project-specific term
  only when it names an existing type, field, or enduring rule, define it at first use, and prefer
  describing concrete inputs and effects.
- Internal design and strategy documents describe the current product and architecture. Keep
  implementation history in `jj` commits.
- For implementation work, update documentation when a change adds or alters a supported rule or
  workflow, or makes an existing statement inaccurate. A bug fix alone does not require a docs
  change. Documentation reviews and corrections can also address clarity, duplication, and gaps.
- When documentation is required, update only the affected source: `design.md` for an enduring
  product rule, user docs or `--help` for user guidance, and the relevant testing document for
  test strategy.

# Behaviour changes

- In user-facing output, identify revisions by `change_id` by default. If a concrete immutable
  snapshot matters, include the `commit_id` second and label it explicitly.
- Read [docs/internals/design.md](docs/internals/design.md) before intentionally changing product
  semantics or adding tests for product behavior. Design prose is derived from principles, not
  the other way around: evaluate a documented behavior on its merits before extending it, and
  prefer deleting case-specific rules that follow from the principles over adding new ones. Never
  add durable transaction or replay state; recovery is observational (see design.md).
- Preserve the core invariants: the `jj` DAG determines stack topology, tracking stores only PR
  links and submitted commits, GitHub PRs follow the local stack, and ambiguous linkage stops
  mutation.

# Testing

- Run `just check` for the default local Ruff, type-check, and test pass before finishing a code
  change. Docs-only edits under `docs/` do not require a test run.
- Run focused tests with `just test`, for example `just test tests/unit/test_jj_client.py`.
- Before adding, modifying, removing, or reviewing tests, fixtures, helpers, or property
  scenarios, read and follow
  [docs/internals/testing-philosophy.md](docs/internals/testing-philosophy.md). Add or retain
  coverage only for a distinct worthwhile risk at the narrowest meaningful layer; search for and
  consolidate overlapping coverage first. For property-harness changes, also follow
  [docs/internals/property-testing.md](docs/internals/property-testing.md).

# Code reviews

- When reviewing changes or existing code, read and follow
  [docs/internals/code-reviews.md](docs/internals/code-reviews.md).
