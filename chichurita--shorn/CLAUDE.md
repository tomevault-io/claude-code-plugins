# Contributing to shorn

Notes for anyone, human or agent, working on this repo from a clone.

shorn turns a Standard Schema you already have (Zod, Valibot, ArkType) into a compact
binary codec. The library is the repo root; `docs/` is a separate Astro workspace
package for <https://shorn.dev>.

## Setup

Requires **pnpm** and **Node 22.13+** to install. The published package supports Node
20. That floor is CI's job to enforce, not yours to develop against.

```sh
pnpm install
```

## The one command that matters

```sh
pnpm check
```

Typecheck, tests, build, and a packaging lint, in that order. **A change is not
finished until this is green.** CI runs exactly this, so a green local `check` is a
good predictor of a green PR.

Narrower loops while you work:

```sh
pnpm test                          # all tests
pnpm test test/envelope.test.ts    # one file
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm examples                      # runs examples/, which assert on their own output
```

There is no lint or format step. Match the surrounding code.

## Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `src/core.ts` | the `m` builders, the wire format, `Reader`/`Writer` |
| `src/standard.ts` | the Standard Schema bridge: `compile`, `encode`, `decode`, `codec` |
| `src/envelope.ts` | `fingerprinted()` and the mismatch prefix |
| `test/` | vitest; `property.test.ts` and `fuzz.test.ts` are generative |
| `bench/` | benchmarks against msgpackr, cbor-x, Avro, Protobuf, SchemaPack, JSON |
| `examples/` | runnable, self-asserting; they double as documentation |

`dist/` is generated and gitignored. Never commit it, and never edit the `version`
field in `package.json` or `CHANGELOG.md`. Tooling owns both.

## Two things to know before you change `src/`

**The wire format is a compatibility promise.** Payloads are tagless and positional: a
value carries no key, no type tag, and no version, so field order and marker layout
*are* the format. Changing the bytes a given schema produces breaks every payload
already written by an earlier version. If that is what your change does, say so
explicitly in the PR. If you are not sure whether it does, open an issue before
writing much code.

**The comments in `src/core.ts` are load-bearing.** Much of that file looks
over-engineered and is not: the odd-looking parts are there for measured reasons, and
the comments record which. Read the comment before simplifying the code under it. If a
measurement is what justified the code, a measurement is what should retire it:
`pnpm regress` compares against a recorded baseline.

## Submitting a change

Say in the PR description what a user of the package would notice, and classify it by
effect on users rather than by diff size: new API is a minor, a fix that keeps the same
bytes is a patch, and anything that changes the bytes or breaks existing payloads is
breaking, however small the diff. That note becomes the release entry, so say *why* as
well as what. Changes confined to `bench/`, `docs/`, or CI need no note.

There is no changeset step. shorn is a single package, so the changelog is written by hand
at release time from the commits. Publishing itself is not manual: a maintainer pushes a
`v*` tag and `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs `pnpm check` and publishes. Nothing about
a contributed change needs to touch that.

Tests are expected with a behavior change. Match the file that already covers the area
rather than adding a new one.

## Maintainers

An untracked `internal/` directory may hold additional local instructions. Read
`internal/AGENTS.local.md` if it is present; if it is not, this file is the whole of it.
