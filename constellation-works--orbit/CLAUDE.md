# Orbit — agent guide

Loaded as both `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

## Rules

- Work only on authorized scope. In a managed activity, leave commits and delivery transitions to the pipeline. Neither implementation nor a PR request authorizes merging.
- Don't invent task IDs — get them from `orbit.task.add`. Don't edit task files directly — use `orbit.task.update`.
- Don't add cross-crate dependencies without updating [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Historical ADRs are not an authority; don't cite them. Judge from current code, tests, and requirements.
- Don't touch `CHANGELOG.md` during tasks; it is compiled at release time ([`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md)).
- Update affected docs in the same PR as the code. Stale docs are a review blocker.
- Every test must exercise behavior. Don't write text-matching tests — `include_str!` plus `contains()` over source, assets, or UI copy pins wording, breaks on every edit, and proves nothing runs. The only exception is a narrow structural safety guard (CSP, sanitizer wrapper, no raw `innerHTML`) whose assertion message names what it protects.

## Branching

- `main` — release branch; only release merges and hotfixes.
- `agent-main` — dev integration; every task PR targets it.
- Promotion and hotfix flow: [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md).

## Gates

`make ci-fast`, `make ci-lint`, and `make goldens` must pass before a task moves to `review`. `make goldens UPDATE=1` regenerates CLI help / MCP snapshot and sandbox profile goldens after an intentional surface or policy change — review the diff. Full `make ci` runs in CI on every PR; don't run it per task.

## Code

- Layering and scoping: [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md). Reusable patterns: [`docs/design-patterns/`](docs/design-patterns/).
- Lints are configured via `[workspace.lints]`: `unwrap`/`expect` are warned on in production code throughout each crate (tests are exempted at crate roots); propagate errors, using `OrbitError` at crate boundaries. No `print!` (use `tracing`), no lock guards across `.await`.
- `missing_docs` is a workspace warning that crate roots may allow while documentation is incomplete. It is currently enforced in `orbit-config` and `orbit-web`; the other crate roots opt out.
- Default to `pub(crate)`; workspace deps via `.workspace = true`; bounded channels; typed `thiserror` variants.
- Test at the boundary first: crate-root integration tests, goldens and a few e2e flows. A unit test is an exception that must meet the admission criteria in [`test_strategy.md`](docs/design-patterns/test_strategy.md) (combinatorial pure logic, deterministic interleaving or fault injection, a security invariant the boundary can't reach, platform-kernel behaviour); never serde round-trips, getters, mock wiring or a second test of one invariant.
- Admitted unit tests live in a sibling `tests/` dir mirroring source filenames ([`test_layout.md`](docs/design-patterns/test_layout.md)); crate-root `tests/` is integration only.
- Before writing a test, weigh what it guards and what it costs: assert what the code guarantees (parses, required fields present, structural safeguards), not policy that lives in config or prompts — crew, model, schedule, complexity, prose wording. A test that pins those turns every ops edit into a red CI; if a pin is truly warranted, cite the incident it guards in the assertion message.
- Never expose internal task/friction IDs in user-facing output, CLI help (Clap renders `///`), or MCP text.
- Fixtures that mutate Orbit state must run in an isolated child process — see [`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#safe-mutable-cli-fixtures).
- Prefer the fewest moving parts: delete dead code and stale docs together, keep compatibility only for an external contract or persisted format.
- File length is a heuristic, not a limit: past ~800 lines, check whether a file holds more than one responsibility and split along those if so; keep closely related functionality together when splitting would only scatter it.
- Report commands and outcomes at handoff — passed, failed, not run — never "tested".

## Local Rust CodeQL checks

For Rust changes in this repository, follow the [local CodeQL runbook](docs/runbooks/codeql-local.md), which uses `scripts/codeql-rust-local.sh`. Its extraction checks are required evidence; a query result from incomplete semantic extraction cannot confirm a repair. Only a Linux host can extract every module: elsewhere the script exits 3 without running, and the check is owed by a Linux run recorded as `codeql` external evidence (runbook, Non-Linux hosts).

## Orbit Workflow

For any Orbit lifecycle work, invoke the `orbit` skill; its `SKILL.md` routes to the matching reference.
