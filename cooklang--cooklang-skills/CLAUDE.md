## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/cooklang-skills/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

# Cooklang

This folder may hold recipes written in [Cooklang](https://cooklang.org), a plain-text recipe format.

- `.cook` files are recipes. Ingredients are `@name{qty%unit}`, cookware `#name{}`, timers `~{qty%unit}`, sections `= Name`, notes `> text`.
- `.menu` files are meal plans that reference recipes.
- `config/aisle.conf` groups shopping-list items by store aisle; `config/pantry.conf` is the pantry inventory.
- Metadata (title, servings, tags, times, source) is YAML frontmatter between `---` lines at the top of the file. Never write the deprecated `>>` metadata lines; convert any you find to frontmatter.

## Use the Cook MCP server

The `cook` MCP server (`npx -y @cookmd/mcp@0.2.3`) reads, searches, validates and writes these files. Prefer its tools over editing by hand or doing arithmetic yourself:

- read and find: `list_recipes`, `read_recipe` (with scaling), `search_recipes`
- check and save: `validate`, then `write_recipe` / `write_menu` / `write_config` (writes are validated and stay inside the recipe folder)
- plan and shop: `shopping_list` (merges, groups by aisle, subtracts the pantry), `pantry_*`
- import and report: `import_recipe`, `render_report`
- nutrition (`get_nutrition`, `aggregate_nutrition`, ...) and photo or social-link import need a cook.md login on Cook Basic or Pro; `login` and `auth_status` handle that. Never estimate nutrition from memory.

The recipe folder is `COOK_RECIPES_DIR`, else the workspace folder the client reports, else the folder the server was started in (never `/`, the home folder or a plugin install folder). If the tools say no recipe folder is set, ask the user for the path and have them set `COOK_RECIPES_DIR` in the server config. If the `cook` tools are missing, tell the user to add the server (see https://github.com/cooklang/cooklang-skills).
