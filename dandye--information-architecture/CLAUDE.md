# Information Architecture Skills for Gemini CLI

A collection of skills for Information Architecture tasks, designed to help with content analysis, organization, and strategy.

## Available Skills

### Content Analysis & Strategy

- **[card-sorting-generate](skills/card-sorting-generate/SKILL.md)**
  Generate materials for card sorting studies. Creates detailed lists of content items (cards) for user research and information architecture validation.

- **[content-analyze-gaps](skills/content-analyze-gaps/SKILL.md)**
  Identify content gaps and organizational opportunities. Analyzes missing content areas, redundancies, and consolidation opportunities.

- **[content-audit](skills/content-audit/SKILL.md)**
  Comprehensive content quality and maintenance assessment. Evaluates documentation quality, relevance, maintenance needs, and provides actionable recommendations.

- **[content-inventory](skills/content-inventory/SKILL.md)**
  Systematic cataloging of information assets. Creates comprehensive inventories of all content with metadata and characteristics.

- **[json-ld-generate](skills/json-ld-generate/SKILL.md)**
  Generate JSON-LD structured data for web content. Maps content to Schema.org types to improve search engine understanding and rich result eligibility.

- **[semantic-markup-generate](skills/semantic-markup-generate/SKILL.md)**
  Generate semantic web markup (JSON-LD, Schema.org) for documents. Enhances SEO and machine readability.

- **[semantic-extract](skills/semantic-extract/SKILL.md)**
  Extract structured data from existing HTML/Markdown content. Identify existing tables, lists, and metadata.

- **[semantic-validate](skills/semantic-validate/SKILL.md)**
  Validate existing JSON-LD or Microdata against Schema.org standards. Ensure markup correctness for search engines.

- **[knowledge-graph-generate](skills/knowledge-graph-generate/SKILL.md)**
  Analyze multiple documents to identify entities and relationships, constructing a knowledge graph structure.

- **[ontology-map](skills/ontology-map/SKILL.md)**
  Map local tags/categories to formal ontologies like SKOS to improve interoperability.

- **[vocabulary-overlap-analysis](skills/vocabulary-overlap-analysis/SKILL.md)**
  Analyze vocabulary overlap and identify named entities unique to domain/document corpora.

- **[named-entity-normalization](skills/named-entity-normalization/SKILL.md)**
  Normalize named entities and concept variants into canonical forms using controlled vocabularies or standard taxonomies.

### Information Architecture

- **[document-tree-generate](skills/document-tree-generate/SKILL.md)**
  Transform lengthy documents into a semantic tree structure. Optimized for context-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM usage.

- **[metadata-schema-design](skills/metadata-schema-design/SKILL.md)**
  Design comprehensive metadata frameworks. Develops structured metadata templates and tagging systems.

- **[ontology-define](skills/ontology-define/SKILL.md)**
  Design formal ontologies using OWL/RDFS. Defines classes, properties, and relationships for complex semantic modeling.

- **[sitemap-generate](skills/sitemap-generate/SKILL.md)**
  Generate hierarchical site structure and navigation maps. Creates visual representations of information architecture and content relationships.

- **[taxonomy-generate](skills/taxonomy-generate/SKILL.md)**
  Develop hierarchical classification systems. Creates parent-child categorical structures for content organization.

- **[thesaurus-generate](skills/thesaurus-generate/SKILL.md)**
  Generate controlled vocabulary thesaurus for content domains. Creates comprehensive thesauri with preferred terms, broader/narrower/related terms.

- **[user-flow-generate](skills/user-flow-generate/SKILL.md)**
  Visualize user paths and interactions. Creates flowcharts representing user journeys to complete specific tasks.

## Capabilities

This extension provides a suite of Information Architecture tools designed to help you analyze, organize, and structure content effectively.

- **Content Strategy**: Analyze content gaps, audit quality, inventory assets, and generate card sorting materials.
- **Structural Design**: Generate sitemaps, user flows, and design metadata schemas.
- **Classification & Semantics**: Develop taxonomies, thesauri, and formal ontologies.
- **Structured Data**: Generate semantic web markup and JSON-LD for documents.
