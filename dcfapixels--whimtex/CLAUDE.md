# WhimTex — agent rules

## Start here

- Code task: read [context overview](Context~/HANDOFF.md); consult only relevant sections of [feature decisions](Context~/DECISIONS.md). These files supplement these rules; they are not a task queue.
- Browser AI / clipboard JSON / standalone HLSL: [AI_AUTHORING.md](AI_AUTHORING.md) → [contract](Documentation~/AI/README.md) → [examples](Documentation~/Examples/Clipboard/README.md).
- Edit an open compositor: read [whimtex-live skill](Skills~/whimtex-live/SKILL.md) first, then [LiveAgentAPI](Documentation~/LiveAgentAPI.md) as needed.
- Edit a compositor by path: [AgentAPI](Documentation~/AgentAPI.md).
- Texture/VFX authoring references: [internal agent samples](Samples~/AgentTextures/README.md). 38 procedural JSON recipes with individual PNG previews, at most 256 pixels on the longest axis; no bundled TIFF duplicates. Read the manifest descriptions/tags and only the relevant examples.
- Do not load all references for an unrelated task. These files describe rules and decisions, not Git status or a task queue.

## Identity and compatibility

- Product: WhimTex. Package: `com.dcfapixels.whimtex`. Namespace: `DCFApixels.WhimTex`; assemblies: `DCFApixels.WhimTex*`.
- Preserve `whimtex_*` commands, `whimtex-live` skill ID, `Temp/WhimTex/` preview path, `whimtex-` USS prefix.
- Preserve existing `MovedFrom` rename markers. Past permission to break a specific format is not permission for future breaking changes.
- Repository: `DCFApixels/WhimTex`; site: https://dcfapixels.github.io/WhimTex/.
- Never increase version without an explicit request, including when committing/pushing.
- Never mention or use names of external graphics editors in code, identifiers, comments, UI, tests/examples, documentation, changelogs, commit messages, pull requests or release notes. Describe behavior generically; do not use editor names as shorthand or comparisons.

## Cross-platform code

- Cross-platform code is the default. OS-specific system-library calls, platform-specific native binaries, explicit CPU/GPU instruction-set intrinsics and hardware/vendor-specific implementation paths may be researched and proposed, with their portability tradeoffs explained, but require explicit user approval before implementation or use. A portable fallback does not waive this requirement; a general optimization request is not approval for such an exception.
- Use portable C# and supported cross-platform Unity APIs. Burst/Jobs are allowed for portable algorithms; automatic compiler/backend targeting is not permission to write hardware-specific branches or intrinsics.
- These restrictions also apply to new test and benchmark code. Existing platform-specific diagnostic helpers are not a precedent or permission to expand their use.

## Execution and safety

- Do not introduce or extend solutions that access Unity internal/non-public APIs through reflection without explicit user approval. This includes reflected delegates, compatibility wrappers, and test or diagnostic code. Prefer supported public APIs; if no suitable alternative exists, explain the limitation and request approval before implementation. Existing reflection-based integrations and general feature requests are not authorization for new internal-API dependencies.
- Follow root project AGENTS.md. Compile only through the connected Unity Editor/Pipeline; no standalone MSBuild or dotnet build. One compilation at a time; check completion/errors. Player builds require a separate request.
- Explicitly target the intended Unity project. Missing tools do not authorize installing packages, starting another Editor or changing unrelated projects/assets.
- For compositor authoring use `WhimTexApi`, not generated YAML or simulated clicks. Source-code work does not require the authoring API.
- Prefer linked built-in/project FX: discover them with `whimtex_fx_catalog`, add through `presetId`, and adjust parameters with `set`. Do not copy unchanged preset HLSL into `code`; reserve inline code for custom algorithms or intentionally independent variants. User-library embedding remains the API's normal behavior.
- Inspect existing documents before path-based edits; use IDs and `@aliases`, not display names. Validate unfamiliar batches with `dryRun:true`; check inner API success, not just CLI transport success.
- After ambiguous timeouts/save failures, inspect before retrying. Adds and strokes are not idempotent.
- Scope assets to the requested output. Do not overwrite unrelated files, change source import settings or delete work to recover from a failed command.
- Verify image-authoring results with an actual rendered preview; no `-nographics`.

## Live generation

- `whimtex_assistant_begin` reserves a named layer and captures context before lengthy generation. Preserve the user's subsequent placement/name/visibility changes.
- Choose source sampling and strict/approximate selection from the request; do not impose one policy on every generation.
- Existing-layer FX/settings generation uses `whimtex_assistant_lock`; release on success or abandonment. Immediate fully specified edits may instead use revision-checked `whimtex_assistant_execute` with no pending jobs; read its shared-operation contract first.
- Inline shader work uses live `fx` requests, not separate shader files by default.
- Live image completion inserts owned Drawing pixels. For path-based imported File workflows, generate the image externally, import with `whimtex_image_import`, reuse its returned path. Read the selected workflow's contract rather than mixing the two.
- Preserve source resolution; fit with transforms. Drawing strokes are for painting/masks/touch-ups, not a substitute for requested image generation.
- New document/layer clipboard recipes use `whimtex.document`; see `AI_AUTHORING.md` and `Documentation~/JSON_FORMAT.md`. Drawing `url` downloads belong only to the legacy `whimtex.layers` compatibility reader, not unified JSON or arbitrary API operations.

## UI and validation

- FX are independent plugins over the shared effect contract. Adding a preset must not change layer generation/behavior, inspect its shader in layer code, or introduce layer-specific hidden outputs for that effect. Use ordinary input images and explicit parameters. Changes to layer behavior require an explicit user request; general FX infrastructure is not permission for preset-specific coupling.

- Prefer compact Unity-style controls, restrained decoration, minimal help text and meaningful changes. Avoid fragile internal APIs for cosmetic features.
- Preserve appearance during refactoring unless asked otherwise.
- Read applicable skills from the available `.agents` installation; do not assume an older `.codex` copy is current.
- Rendering changes: check composite, group/Target input, clipping, thumbnails and export; preserve caller render state and temporary-texture ownership.
- Run relevant tests in `Tests~`; inspect each file first (Node tests, C# snippets and entry-point classes use different runners). Report unverified behavior explicitly.

## Documentation and dependencies

### Changelog and release notes

- `CHANGELOG.md` remains a versioned history: keep a separate block for every package version, including versions that are published without a GitHub release.
- GitHub release notes are a separate aggregation. For a release, merge the complete user-facing entries from every package-version block after the previous GitHub release up to the current version; do not omit intermediate versions or list commits instead of behavior.
- Keep an empty `Unreleased` section for work that has not shipped yet. Release notes must follow the established 0.11.0 structure: concise `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed` and, when relevant, `Upgrade notes` sections. Keep the GitHub release title and notes aligned with the aggregated range.

- Update matching EN/RU/ZH user guides. Keep paths and reciprocal `translations` metadata, including the page itself; add new localized pages together.
- Artist guides: result → controls → visible effect. Keep API/storage/cache/Undo internals in technical references, not user guides. Warnings should concern results, compatibility or loss of work.
- README: short introduction, installation, quick start, guide links. Keep browser-AI entry points discoverable.
- Use the [glossary in feature decisions](Context~/DECISIONS.md#глоссарий) for UI and documentation terminology. Keep UI labels, JSON fields, CLI names and code in English. A terminology agreement does not itself rename existing UI, URLs or API identifiers.
- Update the English authoring/API contract with behavior changes. Change schema generators, then regenerate schemas; do not edit generated schemas alone.
- Validate docs via [building.md](Documentation~/building.md). Documentation builds do not authorize Unity builds/imports.
- Third-party additions/updates: preserve copyright, include license/notices, record source version in `ThirdPartyNotices.md`, acknowledge and link upstream in localized READMEs.
