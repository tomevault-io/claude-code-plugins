Orientation for AI coding agents (and new contributors) working in **DmarcAnalyzerApp** — an agency-first, self-hosted DMARC analyzer (ASP.NET Core + Carter API, React + Vite frontend, PostgreSQL). Read this first, then follow the links into the detailed docs.

## What this project is

One agency workspace monitors DMARC aggregate (RUA) reports for many clients across many domains. Reports are pulled from mailboxes over IMAP, parsed, stored, and surfaced as compliance analytics with per-source drill-down. Multi-tenant (client-scoped), role-gated, and packaged as a single container.

- Product overview & local/Docker run: [`README.md`](README.md)
- Current implementation snapshot (what's actually built): [`docs/planning/status.md`](docs/planning/status.md)
- Prioritized work + recommended sequence: [`docs/planning/backlog.md`](docs/planning/backlog.md)

## Repository layout

- `src/api` — backend. One image and one entrypoint (`Program.cs`), running in the mode `APP_MODE` selects: `api` (REST API + the built React app from `wwwroot`), `worker` (mailbox-sync host), `all` (both in one process), or `migrate` (apply migrations and exit). Backend notes: [`src/api/README.md`](src/api/README.md).
  - `Application/` — service layer (Auth, Analytics, Clients, Domains, MailboxSources, Ingestion, Reports, Security, Users). Carter modules in `Modules/` are thin and delegate here.
  - `Data/` — EF Core `DmarcAnalyzerDbContext`, entities, and `Migrations/`. A design-time factory (`DmarcAnalyzerDbContextFactory`) lets `dotnet ef` run without building the web host.
  - `Middleware/` — `SessionAuthMiddleware` (cookie session → `ICurrentUserContext`) then `RoleAuthorizationMiddleware` (endpoint role enforcement).
- `src/web` — React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind v3. Pages in `src/pages`, primitives in `src/components/ui` + `src/components/data`, shared helpers in `src/lib`. Frontend notes: [`src/web/README.md`](src/web/README.md).
- `src/api.tests` — xUnit tests (EF Core InMemory provider; note raw-SQL paths can't run under InMemory).
- `src/api.integration.tests` — the tests that need a real database: raw SQL, `ON CONFLICT` dedup, transaction boundaries. Starts a PostgreSQL container via Testcontainers, so it needs Docker and takes seconds rather than milliseconds. Kept separate so `dotnet test src/api.tests` stays instant and runs with no daemon.
- `http/api.http` — REST Client request collection for manual API calls.
- `docs/` — see the doc map below.

## Build, test, run

```bash
# Backend build + tests (from repo root)
dotnet build DmarcAnalyzerApp.slnx       # or: dotnet build src/api/DmarcAnalyzer.Api.csproj
dotnet test src/api.tests                 # fast; InMemory provider
dotnet test src/api.integration.tests     # needs Docker; starts PostgreSQL

# Frontend (from src/web)
npm install
npm run build     # tsc -b && vite build   (must pass)
npm test          # vitest run              (must pass; runs in CI)
npm run lint      # eslint .                (must be clean)
npm run dev       # Vite dev server, proxies /api to the local API

# EF Core migrations (from repo root)
dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --project src/api/DmarcAnalyzer.Api.csproj

# Full dev stack in Docker (api + worker + postgres + dev Zitadel)
# Note: the repo-root compose file is the *development* stack and keeps api and
# worker separate. deploy/compose.yml is the shipped one and runs APP_MODE=all.
# Once per clone: the mailbox-credential encryption key is not committed, so
# compose refuses to start until .env has one. Keep it — changing the key makes
# stored mailbox passwords undecryptable.
echo "DMARC_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" > .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

**Local dev URLs:** frontend `http://localhost:5173`, API `http://localhost:5076` (Vite proxies `/api`). **Docker:** API on `http://localhost:8080`, Postgres `localhost:5432`. (You can override host ports locally with a gitignored `docker-compose.override.yml`.)

**If the image build fails at `dotnet restore` with NU1004**, the lockfile and the csproj disagree — you changed a `PackageReference` and `src/api/packages.lock.json` was not regenerated. The image restores in locked mode on purpose, so that a stale lockfile stops the build rather than quietly resolving a different dependency graph into the artifact people run. NU1004 offers two remedies and the first one is wrong here: do **not** disable `RestoreLockedMode` to get past it, that removes the check instead of fixing what it caught. Regenerate and commit:

```bash
dotnet restore src/api/DmarcAnalyzer.Api.csproj --force-evaluate
```

A local `dotnet build`/`dotnet test` will *not* reproduce this — `RestoreLockedMode` is on for CI and inside the image, not for your working tree (see `src/Directory.Build.props`), so drift is invisible until one of those two runs.

### Working in a worktree

A fresh worktree has none of this repo's gitignored files, and two of them gate whether it can build or run at all:

```bash
cp ../DmarcAnalyzerApp/.env .          # or wherever the original checkout is
cd src/web && npm install              # ~274M; or symlink node_modules if package-lock.json is untouched
```

- **`.env` must be copied, not regenerated.** Compose refuses to start without `DMARC_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and a *new* key makes every mailbox password already in the database undecryptable.
- **`docker-compose.override.yml` is gitignored too**, so a worktree lacks whatever host-port remapping the original had — see the compose notes above.
- `bin/`, `obj/` and `src/web/dist/` rebuild themselves; they need nothing.
- `.gitignore` excludes `.claude/`, so worktrees created under `.claude/worktrees/` never appear as untracked noise.

## Architecture & conventions — where to read

- System architecture: [`docs/planning/architecture.md`](docs/planning/architecture.md)
- Data model (entities, keys, tenancy paths, retention): [`docs/planning/data-model.md`](docs/planning/data-model.md)
- API contract (implemented + target endpoints): [`docs/planning/api-contract.md`](docs/planning/api-contract.md)
- Milestone sequencing: [`docs/planning/roadmap.md`](docs/planning/roadmap.md)
- Planning decisions & product direction: [`docs/planning/README.md`](docs/planning/README.md)

### Operations runbooks — [`docs/ops/`](docs/ops/)
- [Directory listings](docs/ops/directory-listings.md) — Artifact Hub is live with the Verified publisher badge; the awesome-selfhosted PR was closed unmerged without comment; Umbrel and CasaOS are awaiting review
- [Configuration reference](docs/ops/configuration.md) — **every** setting, and the same set on Compose and Kubernetes. `ConfigurationContractTests` fails the build if a setting exists in code and is missing here, so treat it as canonical; the website's configuration page links to it rather than copying it.
- [Cutting a release](docs/ops/release.md) — tag-driven; merging to `main` does not publish a release. A tag also publishes the Helm chart to `oci://ghcr.io/dmarc-analyzer-net/charts/dmarc-analyzer`.
- [Migrating a running instance](docs/ops/migrating-a-running-instance.md) — and why a green healthcheck does not prove the schema is current.
- [Upgrading PostgreSQL](docs/ops/upgrading-postgresql.md) — 17 to 18. No in-place path exists; a premature tag bump fails loudly and is reversible.

## Key domain concepts (so you don't misread the code)

- **Tenancy**: `client` is the tenant root. `domain.ClientId` and `mailbox_source.DefaultClientId` are direct keys; reports/records derive tenancy transitively through the domain. Domain names are globally unique. New domains auto-create under the mailbox's default client.
- **AuthN is pluggable, authZ is always in-app** (ADR 0007). Local password or OIDC both mint the same `dmarc_session` cookie; roles + per-client grants are decided in the app, never by the IdP. Roles: `agency_admin` (all), `agency_analyst` (all clients, read + ops), `client_viewer` (granted clients only, read-only). Endpoints are **deny-by-default for client_viewer** — new endpoints must opt in via `.AllowClientViewer()`.
- **Enforcement status** (Domains/Detail): derived from the **effective** DMARC policy + compliance — `enforced` (p=reject) / `ramping` (p=quarantine) / `spoofing` (unprotected + failing) / `monitoring` / `no_data`. "Effective" matters: a subdomain publishing no record of its own inherits the organisational domain's `sp=` (else `p=`) via a DNS tree walk, so it can be `enforced` on a policy it does not publish. `domain.DnsPolicyInheritedFrom` records where that came from. A subdomain publishing its own weaker record still wins.
- **Analytics windows** anchor to the newest report date, not wall-clock (data is often backfilled).
- **Exactly one ingestion worker per database.** There is no claim mechanism in the queue — `QueueWorkerService` reads every active source and iterates. Reports survive a second worker (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on real unique indexes), but alert and digest email duplicate, the retention purge throws, and the mailbox checkpoint can move *backwards*. `WorkerSingleInstanceLock` takes a Postgres advisory lock so a second worker exits instead of starting. Lifting the limit is scoped in the backlog; do not assume it is only a Kubernetes concern.

## Configuration (env vars / appsettings)

- `APP_MODE` — `api`, `worker`, `all` (both in one process — what the shipped compose file uses), or `migrate` (apply pending migrations and exit). **Any other value fails startup** rather than defaulting, because a typo that serves the console while ingesting nothing passes every check an operator makes.
- `ConnectionStrings__Default` — Postgres connection.
- `Database__MigrateOnStartup` — `true` applies EF migrations on API start (enabled in compose).
- `Security__CredentialEncryptionKey` — base64 32-byte key; AES-256-GCM at rest for mailbox passwords. Absent ⇒ plaintext passthrough + startup warning (dev only).
- `Auth__Oidc__*` — optional OIDC front door (`Enabled`, `Authority`, `ClientId`, `ClientSecret`, `Scopes`, `DisplayName`, `DefaultRole`, `AutoProvision`, `RequireHttpsMetadata`). Off by default. See the [Zitadel guide](docs/ops/oidc-zitadel.md).
- `Worker__*` — polling interval, batch sizes, retry/timeout controls, and `EnforceSingleInstance`.
- `OTEL_*` — OpenTelemetry, using the specification's own variable names rather than settings of ours. Off until `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set (or an exporter is set to `console`); with none set the SDK is never registered. Traces cover ASP.NET Core, **Npgsql at the driver level**, outbound `HttpClient` and runtime meters. Full table in [`docs/ops/configuration.md`](docs/ops/configuration.md).
- `Network__*` — forwarded headers behind a proxy. Off by default, and **refused if turned on with an empty trust list**; without it every audit entry records the proxy's address.

The full list with defaults is in [`docs/ops/configuration.md`](docs/ops/configuration.md), which is build-enforced. Add a setting there in the same PR that adds it to the code, or the build fails.

## Working agreements

- **`main` is protected**: no direct pushes. Branch → implement → verify → open a PR (`gh pr create`). Merges happen via PR.
- **Merges are squash, and this repo does not auto-delete branches on merge** (`git log main` shows `(#N)` trailers, no merge commits since #17; `delete_branch_on_merge` is off). Two things follow for a stacked PR (one branched from another, not from `main`):
  - After the base PR is squash-merged, its branch still exists and the stacked PR still targets it — GitHub will **not** auto-retarget the stacked PR to `main`, because that auto-retarget only fires when the base branch is deleted through GitHub's own merge-and-delete button, not via `git push --delete` or any other route. Retarget it yourself: `gh pr edit <n> --base main`.
  - Do this while the PR is still **open**. If the base branch is deleted first (including by you, via `git push origin --delete <branch>`), GitHub closes the stacked PR outright rather than retargeting it, and neither `gh pr reopen` nor the REST API will reopen a PR whose base branch is gone ("state cannot be changed. The `<branch>` branch has been deleted."). The only fix is recreating that branch at its last commit (`git push origin <local-branch>:refs/heads/<branch>`) so the reopen succeeds, then retargeting and only *then* deleting it again.
  - After retargeting, `git rebase origin/main` on the stacked branch — git recognizes the now-squashed commit as already applied and skips it cleanly (`warning: skipped previously applied commit`), leaving a clean two-commit diff against `main` instead of a spurious conflict from the pre-squash and post-squash trees disagreeing on a shared line.
- **Work in a git worktree, not the shared checkout**, whenever a task will edit tracked files toward a commit — more than one agent session works in these checkouts at once, and a bare `git status` there shows other people's changes as readily as your own. Diff only the paths you touched (`git diff --stat -- <paths>`), stage explicitly (never `git add -A`), and re-run the checks at the end, because a green run says nothing about a tree someone else edited afterwards. See "Working in a worktree" below for what a fresh one needs.
- **Verify before shipping**: build + tests + lint, and for user-facing changes run the stack (`docker compose up -d --build`) and check the real app. `docs/planning/status.md` and `backlog.md` should be updated as part of feature PRs.
- **Backend**: modules stay thin; put logic in `Application/` services. Prefer EF LINQ; when a query needs raw SQL (e.g. `DISTINCT ON`, per-group aggregates), keep it tenant-scoped and remember InMemory tests can't execute it.
- **Ingestion changes need a real database.** Every test uses `UseInMemoryDatabase`, which supports neither the raw SQL nor the transactions `MailboxSyncService` depends on — two real bugs there were invisible to the suite and had to be found by hand against Postgres. Until the integration harness in the backlog exists, verify changes to that file against a real database and say so in the PR.
- **Frontend**: TypeScript strict, sentence-case copy, no emoji, mono font for technical values (domains, IPs, policies). Use the design tokens (CSS vars + Tailwind theme) and existing primitives — the old shadcn light-blue tokens are gone.
- **Tone/content**: plain, technical, no hype (see the design/content notes referenced from the planning docs).

## Quick task pointers

- Add/adjust an endpoint → Carter module in `src/api/Modules/` + service in `src/api/Application/**`, stamp role metadata, add the type to `src/web/src/lib/*.ts`, consume in a page.
- Change the schema → edit the entity + `DmarcAnalyzerDbContext` mapping, then `dotnet ef migrations add`.
- Ingestion/parsing changes → `src/api/Application/Ingestion/MailboxSyncService.cs` + `src/api/Application/Reports/DmarcRuaReportParser.cs`; see [`docs/ops/mailbox-sync.md`](docs/ops/mailbox-sync.md).
