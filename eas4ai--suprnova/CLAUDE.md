# Suprnova Live -- Conventions

Status: Normative
Last revised: 2026-09-10

## Authority and application

These conventions govern Suprnova Live design, implementation, generated code,
browser assets, component-library artifacts, tests, references, and
documentation. The machine production coding standard and any future
repository-local `BEST_PRACTICES.md` remain authoritative. A repository-local
`BEST_PRACTICES.md` overrides the machine copy.

`crates/suprnova-live/` is the internal Suprnova Live engine subtree, not a
specification-only repository or a third-party crate. It keeps implementation
beside the normative `docs/specs/suprnova-live/` set and
`scripts/check-specs.mjs`; those files, browser sources and artifacts, fixtures,
tests, benchmarks, and implementation documents are one maintained authority.
The former `/home/shawn/workspace2/suprnova-live` checkout is immutable
historical provenance only. Its large `reference/` catalog and optional
`suprnova-live.zip` Fable handoff export remain non-normative historical
artifacts and do not become a parallel current contract. The active iteration
contract named under Completeness and scope authorizes coherent changes in an
isolated Suprnova worktree while unrelated Suprnova and Magnetar work remains
untouched.

## Implementation standards

### Completeness and scope

- The active implementation contract is [`iterations/006.md`](iterations/006.md).
  Closed contracts remain historical evidence; preliminary sequencing in an
  older contract does not override the active confirmed boundary.
- Implement the active iteration contract completely. Do not substitute an
  MVP, placeholder, TODO, empty adapter, unverified scaffold, or narrower
  behavior for an agreed capability.
- A change owns its whole contract: implementation, public facade, macro/checker
  metadata, browser behavior, tests, documentation, generated templates,
  reference impact, and migration note where applicable.
- Attractive adjacent work is not implicit scope. Record it through
  `/next-iteration` after Stage 6 rather than coupling it to the current change.
- Existing unrelated work in Suprnova, Magnetar, or this workspace is preserved.
  Never rewrite, revert, reformat, or commit another contributor's changes merely
  to simplify Live work.

### Rust safety and API design

- Public application-facing APIs live under `suprnova::live` or
  `suprnova::view`; consumers never import `suprnova-live` directly.
- The internal engine crate does not depend on the `suprnova` facade. Framework
  services enter through narrow adapter traits and typed contexts to prevent a
  crate cycle and make conformance fixtures independent.
- Public operations return typed `Result` values and preserve causal errors.
  Panics are limited to proven internal invariants in tests or unreachable
  generated states; hostile input, provider failure, and application mistakes
  are never panic paths.
- Production code contains no `unsafe`; the engine crate keeps
  `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. The `suprnova-live` package lint is `deny`
  rather than `forbid` for one recorded reason: `benches/render_cache_budget.rs`
  allows `unsafe` with a written reason for the counting global allocator that
  measures the Complete L0 allocation budget, and that benchmark holds the only
  `unsafe` in the subtree. A later proposal requiring `unsafe` needs a
  separately approved, documented safety case and cannot enter as an
  implementation convenience.
- Public items have useful rustdoc because `suprnova` denies missing docs and
  broken or private intra-doc links.
- Clippy warnings are reviewed and resolved, but commands and gates do not use
  blanket `-D warnings`. An intentional lint suppression uses the narrowest
  practical scope and `#[allow(clippy::lint_name, reason = "why this is safe")]`.
  Crate-wide or category-wide allowances require a dated specification decision.
- Prefer owned immutable values and explicit state transitions. Interior
  mutability, global state, and dynamic typing require a demonstrated boundary
  need and tests for lifecycle and concurrency.

### Errors and diagnostics

- `LiveError` and subordinate enums distinguish protocol, validation,
  authentication, authorization, CSRF, snapshot, revision, render, morph,
  provider, cache, upload, compatibility, and internal failures.
- Error conversion preserves a stable machine category, safe recovery
  instruction, source context, and causal chain. Do not flatten errors to strings
  or use status codes as the only taxonomy.
- Production messages contain no snapshot bytes, signatures, cookies, tokens,
  transient models, private HTML, SQL values, stack traces, or policy internals.
- Developer diagnostics point to the Rust declaration, template path and source
  region, directive, component, island, lifecycle phase, and correlation ID when
  available.

### Async execution and concurrency

- Tokio tasks are structured and cancellation-aware. Detached tasks require an
  explicit owner, shutdown path, bounded queue, and observability.
- Never hold a blocking mutex, database transaction, provider lease, or mutable
  component borrow across an unrelated `.await`.
- Every queue, batch, upload, body, parser, recursion depth, retry, lease,
  connection, and diagnostic buffer has a configured bound.
- Timeouts and cancellation do not imply rollback of an external effect.
  Transaction, idempotency, outbox, and delivery semantics remain explicit.
- The instance-ledger contract guarantees at most one committed accepted
  outcome per base revision. Action bodies are safe to invoke again before
  commit and must not claim exactly-once external behavior.

### Rendering and templates

- Routes and components render through `suprnova::view`. Askama is the normative
  checked grammar, but Askama-specific types do not leak into handler or
  component signatures unless the facade explicitly owns the wrapper.
- Templates are external `.html` files. They contain presentation conditions,
  loops, includes, layouts, semantic markup, and declarative attributes, not
  authorization decisions, database access, or arbitrary JavaScript.
- Escaping is default. Trusted HTML uses one explicit audited type and cannot be
  constructed from untrusted text through a convenience conversion.
- A render is deterministic for declared inputs and dependency generations.
  Locale, time, randomness, feature state, configuration, assets, and identity
  that affect bytes enter the render context and dependency/variance machinery.
- A failed render publishes no partial document, island, snapshot, cache entry,
  header set, or success outcome.

### State, protocol, and cryptography

- Component fields are private to the server unless generated metadata marks
  them model-bindable. Locked, server-only, computed, and transient categories
  are distinct types or metadata states, not naming conventions.
- Protocol structs use `serde` with explicit field names, deny duplicate or
  unknown required fields as specified, and reject unbounded collections before
  expensive allocation.
- Public JSON field names use `snake_case`. Rust uses the same semantic names;
  TypeScript adapters may expose idiomatic local names only behind generated
  codecs and conformance fixtures.
- Signed snapshot bodies use the versioned canonical JSON profile. Do not sign
  `serde_json` output whose order or numeric representation is incidental.
- Snapshot keys are derived per purpose and version with HKDF-SHA-256 and sign
  with HMAC-SHA-256. Verification uses explicit key IDs, bounded rotation
  windows, and constant-time comparison.
- Known snapshot extensions use exact registered canonical schemas and hard
  independent byte/cardinality/depth bounds; unknown well-formed namespaced
  extensions follow the owning snapshot version's compatibility rule. Public
  seeds never inherit instance-only extension authority.
- Child-parameter envelope versions have separate schema discriminators, typed
  verified values, and cryptographic purposes. A verifier never reinterprets an
  older envelope as a newer exact-binding contract.
- Authorization reads use provider contracts designed for correctness and
  linearized with their mutations. Broad diagnostic inspection and
  browser-carried snapshots never substitute for those reads.
- Protocol, snapshot, directive, view metadata, and cache-entry fixtures are
  consumed by both Rust and TypeScript tests. A handwritten duplicate schema is
  not a second source of truth.
- Iteration 004 conformance lives in `fixtures/v4/`. Upload protocol v1 and
  asynchronous envelope/subscription protocol v1 remain independently
  versioned while interoperating with Live update protocols v1/v2. The feature
  registry ABI is `suprnova.live.features.v1`; its checked capabilities are
  `uploads@1` and `async@1` against compatible core `>=0.1.0 <0.2.0`.

### RenderCache and providers

- RenderCache is separate from the generic application cache. It stores typed
  Complete or Composite representations and proof metadata, never arbitrary
  handler values masquerading as a response.
- `RenderStore`, `LiveInstanceLedger`, `RebuildCoordinator`, and
  `GenerationLedger` remain independent traits. A provider implements only the
  capabilities it can prove.
- Tier 0 is the behavioral reference. Tier 1 and Tier 2 reuse the same semantic
  suite and add topology-specific CAS, lease, fencing, eviction, partition, and
  failure fixtures.
- Generation truth is database-authoritative at every tier. Hints, memory, Redis,
  Memcached, files, and blob stores may accelerate observation but do not become
  correctness authority.
- Cache keys and metrics contain stable purpose-specific digests, never raw
  cookies, session IDs, principal secrets, arbitrary URLs, or high-cardinality
  values.
- Complete hot hits retain shared immutable bytes through response construction.
  A full-body clone, handler call, template render, or database query on that path
  is a performance defect unless the owning spec explicitly requires it.

### Browser runtime

- Runtime source is strict TypeScript targeting ES2020 and is built into
  deterministic versioned ESM and classic-script artifacts with source maps kept
  out of production responses by default.
- Asset manifest schema v2 records engine `0.1.0`, runtime contract version 1,
  Live protocol versions 1/2, snapshot version 1, and exact `core@1`,
  `stimulus@1`, `uploads@1`, and `async@1` ESM/classic roles. A version change
  updates generated contracts, fixtures, compatibility checks, and this record
  together.
- The universal core and optional Stimulus/upload/async ESM/classic feature
  pairs are selected only through trusted rendered roles and the typed asset
  manifest. Optional loading deduplicates and registers through the core
  lifecycle rather than starting another runtime or accepting element-selected
  artifact URLs. A bundler may import equivalent optional package exports.
- Application developers can use the shipped runtime without Node, npm, a
  bundler, Stimulus, or a client component framework. Bundler integration is an
  optional delivery choice for the same artifact and protocol.
- The core runtime owns `live:` parsing, local signals, scheduling, transport,
  response ordering, registered effects, and the Suprnova morph adapter.
  Neither Stimulus nor Suprnova's bridge/continuity implementation is present in
  core. The separately shipped adapter loads only when an application chooses
  custom controllers and still requires an application-supplied `Application`.
- Event handling is delegated where semantics permit. Island, controller,
  observer, listener, timer, and upload resources connect and dispose exactly
  once.
- No `eval`, `new Function`, server-returned script, inline expression language,
  or monkey-patch of private Idiomorph/Stimulus state is permitted.
- DOM writes use semantic platform APIs, preserve trusted types/CSP contracts,
  and pass oldest-supported plus current-browser fixtures.

### Components and accessibility

- Official components begin with semantic native HTML. Custom behavior is added
  only where the native element cannot satisfy the specified interaction.
- Component presentation uses Tailwind CSS 4 utilities and versioned semantic
  theme tokens. Raw palette values and component-private design constants do not
  become public theme APIs.
- Each component documents anatomy, variants, sizes, states, keys, Live/local
  ownership, keyboard behavior, accessible name/description, focus behavior,
  reduced motion, and morph continuity.
- WCAG 2.2 AA is the baseline. Automated accessibility checks do not replace
  manual keyboard and assistive-technology review for critical components.

### Observability and performance

- Use Suprnova tracing and metrics facilities. Spans and metrics correlate work
  through bounded identifiers and never record payload bodies or secrets.
- Fast paths have named workloads, explicit provider work, allocation/copy
  expectations, p50/p95 data, and checked-in baselines. Hello-world throughput
  alone cannot substantiate a performance claim.
- Benchmark changes run correctness and security assertions beside performance
  measurements. A faster path that weakens coherence, privacy, authorization,
  revision, or recovery semantics fails.
- Architecture performance budget v1 in `00-overview.md` is release-blocking.
  Budget revision and implementation optimization are separate changes unless
  the developer explicitly approves them together.
- An artifact with no absolute transfer ceiling still has mechanical drift
  control. Its reviewed artifact-size baseline uses a closed, append-only,
  version-controlled history with a source commit plus a decision record that
  both strictly predate the baseline-append commit, artifact hashes, rationale,
  and deterministic measurement method. Stored hashes authenticate the exact
  historical artifact; a changed current-candidate hash does not fail by itself.
  The immutable Task 6 anchor cannot be overwritten, deleted, or collapsed, and
  the current candidate is never an implicit or automatically written baseline.
  More than the approved drift threshold requires an explicit reviewed baseline
  decision in a prior immutable change; it is not an absolute size veto.

### Testing strategy

- Unit tests own pure codecs, keys, state machines, parsers, classification, and
  provider primitives. Property and fuzz tests own external parsers and
  canonical round trips.
- Macro UI tests own valid/invalid declarations and source diagnostics.
  Golden fixtures are small, reviewed, and updated only with an explained
  contract change.
- Integration tests own middleware ordering, sessions, CSRF, authorization,
  transactions, ORM generations, real providers, rendering, CLI scaffolds, and
  dogfood application flows.
- Browser tests own DOM identity, forms, selection, IME, focus, controllers,
  signals, transitions, uploads, offline/retry, history, bfcache, CSP,
  accessibility, and old/new runtime compatibility.
- Production-build test hooks declare a 30-second timeout and build into unique
  temporary output roots. Tests that must mutate the shared deterministic
  `dist/` set instead share one cross-process production-build lock. Other tests
  keep their normal timeout; concurrent processes may not compare half-built
  artifacts.
- Concurrency tests use deterministic barriers, injected clocks, and controlled
  providers rather than sleep-based probability.
- Every defect receives a failing regression test at the lowest layer that can
  prove it, plus a higher-level test when the failure crossed a subsystem
  boundary.

### Production build shape

- A documented production build shape SHALL exist in which the framework's
  `testing` feature is off, and the framework, the CLI scaffold's generated
  application, and the dogfood application SHALL build and boot in it.
- Every test seam SHALL be absent from a binary built that way, checked by a
  build assertion or a test rather than by reading the source.
- The default build and every `_for_test` consumer SHALL stay unchanged, so
  day-to-day verification is not narrowed by the new shape, and the feature
  matrix step SHALL cover the testing-off build of the framework crate.

### Documentation and translation parity

- Inline-code-span parity SHALL hold across the whole manual: the six mirrors
  SHALL agree with the English chapter for every chapter rather than for a
  listed subset of them.
- The parity rule's tokenizer SHALL treat a quoted backtick as quoted text, so
  that only real drift is reported, and every real drift SHALL be fixed by
  translation rather than by narrowing the rule.
- The ratchet list of span-checked sources SHALL be retired once every source
  is covered, and the translation lock SHALL be restamped for every chapter
  that changed.

```

The internal crate may split a module only when it has a coherent owned
contract; directory count is not a goal. Shared helpers live with their owning
domain unless two independent domains require the same stable abstraction.

The top level of `docs/specs/suprnova-live/` is closed to the 26 numbered
specifications plus `conventions.md`, `glossary.md`, and `ux.md`. Supplemental
normative material, such as a threat model, lives in a named subdirectory and is
linked from the numbered specification that owns its requirements; adding it
also requires extending the checker and any present handoff archive contract
deliberately.

Iteration contracts live in `iterations/NNN.md`. The checker validates their
numeric name, project/iteration title, scope-contract status, agreed ISO date,
required sections, links, text hygiene, and exact bytes in any present handoff
archive. Capture for a future decision lives under `iterations/next/` and does
not become the current contract until promoted through `/next-iteration`.

### Rust and generated names

- Crates and modules use `snake_case`; types and traits use `UpperCamelCase`;
  functions, fields, actions, and events use `snake_case`; constants use
  `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Public framework types prefer the `Live` or `Render` qualifier only when the
  unqualified term would collide with an existing Suprnova concept.
- Procedural attributes use concise lower-case names such as `#[live]`,
  `#[action]`, `#[model]`, `#[locked]`, and `#[server_only]`. Their generated
  contract identities are fully qualified and versioned.
- Standalone Live macro expansion names only final `::suprnova::live` and
  `::suprnova::live::__private` paths. A dev-only facade fixture supplies those
  exact paths to macro UI tests; production expansion never names the
  development engine or macro packages.
- Error variants name the violated contract rather than the current
  implementation, for example `SnapshotExpired` rather than `HmacFailed` when
  expiry is the public outcome.
- Test names describe observable behavior and expected outcome. Avoid issue
  numbers or implementation function names as the only explanation.

### Templates, directives, and components

- Application Live templates use `.html` and reside in the conventional
  application view tree selected by `suprnova::view`; generated examples use a
  `live/` subdirectory without making that path part of component identity.
- `live:` directive names and modifiers use lower-case kebab form. Public action,
  field, event, and effect values map to generated stable names; arbitrary Rust
  paths never appear in HTML.
- DOM keys are stable logical identities, not list indices, random render values,
  timestamps, database display text, or mutable labels.
- Official component names describe semantic roles. Variant names describe
  purpose or emphasis rather than hard-coded color, pixel value, or current
  visual appearance.
- Theme tokens use Tailwind CSS 4 namespaces where they intentionally generate
  utilities and `--suprnova-*` semantic CSS variables for component roles that
  must remain stable across palettes.

### Protocol, cache, and storage names

- Media types, endpoint metadata, protocol fields, snapshot forms, cache entry
  kinds, generation keys, and provider capabilities use versioned constants from
  one Rust source of truth and generated TypeScript fixtures.
- Provider keys begin with a versioned purpose namespace and hash unbounded or
  sensitive dimensions. Key construction has golden tests and never depends on
  debug formatting.
- Database objects use the `suprnova_live_` or `suprnova_render_` prefix and
  reversible timestamped migrations. Migration names state the durable contract,
  not the backing product.
- Telemetry names begin with `suprnova.live.` or `suprnova.render_cache.` and use
  bounded enumerated attributes.

## Dependency and version policy

- Cargo and npm lockfiles are ground truth for exact transitive versions.
  Overview versions identify intentional architecture lines, not an alternative
  dependency inventory.
- Askama, Idiomorph, Stimulus, Tailwind CSS, `imagesize`, canonicalization, and
  cryptographic changes require upstream changelog/license/security review plus
  Live conformance, artifact/dependency-size, fuzz, and migration evidence as
  applicable.
- Idiomorph is vendored or locked into the shipped runtime artifact. Application
  package resolution cannot silently replace it with an incompatible version.
- The oldest supported browser matrix moves only in a dated normative revision.
  Optional APIs remain feature-detected even when all current browsers implement
  them.
- Rust MSRV follows the Suprnova workspace. Runtime TypeScript and npm versions
  are pinned in the internal browser package and updated deliberately.

## Verification commands

Commands below are run from the named repository root. A check is reported as
passing only when that exact command ran successfully. Heavy Cargo commands are
never run concurrently with another build in the Suprnova tree.

### Integrated specification subtree

From the Suprnova workspace root, per documentation change:

```bash
node crates/suprnova-live/scripts/check-specs.mjs
node crates/suprnova-live/scripts/check-implementation-docs.mjs
git diff --check
```

Before a documentation commit:

```bash
node crates/suprnova-live/scripts/check-specs.mjs
node crates/suprnova-live/scripts/check-implementation-docs.mjs
git diff --check
git status --short
```

A locally installed Same Page Stop hook may supplement these commands; it never
replaces the explicit structural check.

The former standalone Fable ZIP is historical provenance. Do not regenerate or
use it as current specification authority.

### Integrated Live subtree: `crates/suprnova-live/`

From the Suprnova workspace root, while iterating on Rust:

```bash
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo check -p suprnova-live --all-targets --all-features
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo test -p suprnova-live <test-filter>
```

After a coherent Live task:

```bash
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo fmt \
  -p suprnova-live -p suprnova-macros \
  -p suprnova-live-macro-fixture -p suprnova-live-test-support -- --check
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo clippy \
  -p suprnova-live -p suprnova-macros \
  -p suprnova-live-macro-fixture -p suprnova-live-test-support \
  --all-targets --all-features
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo test \
  -p suprnova-live -p suprnova-macros \
  -p suprnova-live-macro-fixture -p suprnova-live-test-support \
  --all-targets --all-features --no-fail-fast
```

Before any push from the integrated workspace:

```bash
SUPRNOVA_LIVE_RELEASE=0 CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 crates/suprnova-live/scripts/gate.sh
```

Before a release or when upload/provider/stream/resource-budget behavior changes:

```bash
SUPRNOVA_LIVE_RELEASE=1 CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 crates/suprnova-live/scripts/gate.sh
```

When a task changes the public framework integration as well as the engine:

```bash
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo check -p suprnova-live -p suprnova
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo test -p suprnova-live <test-filter>
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo test -p suprnova --test <affected-live-file>
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo test -p suprnova-macros
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo test -p suprnova-cli --test template_drift
```

After a public API or generated-template change:

```bash
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo test -p suprnova-cli --test scaffold_snapshot -- --ignored
```

### Browser runtime: `crates/suprnova-live/browser/`

Dependency installation after checkout or lockfile change:

```bash
npm --prefix crates/suprnova-live/browser ci
```

Per runtime task:

```bash
npm --prefix crates/suprnova-live/browser run format:check
npm --prefix crates/suprnova-live/browser run lint
npm --prefix crates/suprnova-live/browser run typecheck
npm --prefix crates/suprnova-live/browser test
npm --prefix crates/suprnova-live/browser run test:browser
npm --prefix crates/suprnova-live/browser run build
```

`build` must reproduce checked artifacts byte-for-byte from the lockfile and
source, and it prints the exact raw and Brotli bytes of every artifact. No
artifact has a byte ceiling.

### Provider and browser matrix checks

Provider conformance, oldest-browser, current-browser, accessibility, and CSP
matrix commands shall be wired into `crates/suprnova-live/scripts/gate.sh` or a
script it invokes before the corresponding implementation can be called
complete. Benchmark commands are on-demand tools and are not wired into the
gate. Tests
requiring Redis, Memcached, PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, or a real browser remain
explicit and unattended; credentials are never embedded in commands or
fixtures.

## Decisions and revisions

- 2026-09-10 -- Delivered the Documentation and translation parity rule:
  inline-code-span parity now holds across the whole manual, and the ratchet
  is gone. `_compare_shapes` in `scripts/check-manual-structure.py` compares
  code spans for every chapter and all six mirrors unconditionally;
  `SPAN_CHECKED_SOURCES` and its seven-chapter allowlist no longer exist. The
  corpus started this plan at 1,591 span problems across 68 of 111 chapters;
  958 of them traced to one malformed construct in `manual/seeding.md` (a
  backslash-escaped backtick inside a single-backtick span, which CommonMark
  does not honor), leaving 633 genuine translation drifts after that fix and
  the paragraph-bounding tokenizer change. Paragraph-bounding itself cleared
  none of that count: on this corpus every amplified problem came through the
  seeding.md construct, so bounding is containment against a future
  mis-nesting, not a fix for anything reported here. A block-quote handling
  fix in the checker's tokenizer cleared 8 more problems the corpus never
  really had; the remaining 625 were fixed by translation across five
  batches. The whole manual and all six mirrors now report zero span
  problems, and `test_the_real_manual_tree_reports_no_problems` runs the
  checker over the real `manual/` tree so a future regression fails the
  suite and not only the gate.
- 2026-09-09 -- Delivered the production build shape rule: `app/Cargo.toml`
  and the CLI scaffold's Rust and API templates split the framework
  dependency into a production entry (`default-features = false` plus the
  nine non-`testing` defaults) and a `[dev-dependencies]` entry
  (`features = ["testing"]`), so the shape holds by construction rather
  than by discipline. `framework/tests/fixtures/testing-off-probe/` is a
  separate-workspace probe crate that proves every named test seam is
  absent from that shape by failing to compile without `testing` and
  compiling with it, `scripts/check-feature-matrix.sh` gained a matching
  production-shape profile, and `scripts/check-production-build.sh`
  builds the dogfood binary in that shape, runs its migrations, and
  answers one request; the monorepo gate gained the matching
  `production-build` step, recorded as the Production build shape rule.
- 2026-09-08 -- Advanced the active contract to iteration 006, the sweep of
  every staged capture; iteration 005 closed with its definition of done met.
  The authority statement now names the active contract rather than one
  iteration, so it does not go stale at the next advance.
- 2026-09-08 -- Promoted `test-seams-in-ordinary-builds.md` from
  `iterations/next/` into iteration 006: a documented production build shape
  with the framework `testing` feature off, in which no test seam is present
  in the binary, recorded as the Production build shape rule.
- 2026-09-08 -- Promoted `whole-manual-inline-span-parity.md` from
  `iterations/next/` into iteration 006: inline-code-span parity across every
  manual chapter, with the tokenizer corrected and the ratchet list retired,
  recorded as the Documentation and translation parity rule.
- 2026-09-07 -- Scoped the no-`unsafe` rule so the Complete L0 allocation
  budget can be measured. The engine crate root SHALL keep
  `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`; the package lint becomes `deny` so that exactly
  one benchmark target, `benches/render_cache_budget.rs`, MAY allow `unsafe`
  with a written reason for the counting global allocator that budget needs.
  That benchmark holds the only `unsafe` in the subtree, and a later proposal
  requiring `unsafe` still needs its own approved safety case. The module
  layout gains `framework/benches/render_cache_workloads.rs`, the host-level
  RenderCache benchmark, which contains no `unsafe`. Rejected leaving the
  package lint at `forbid` and measuring allocations from outside the
  process, which cannot see them, and rejected a separate crate for the
  allocator, which would add a workspace member to hold one forwarding
  allocator used by one benchmark.
- 2026-09-01 -- Benchmark and artifact budgets are on-demand tools, not gate
  phases; `scripts/gate.sh` verifies correctness and security only. Dedicated
  S1 and B1 qualification is release-checklist work outside Iteration 005, and
  the artifact size history that raised the historical-baseline question was
  deleted with the artifact budget script, so the release blockers named in
  the 2026-08-31 entry no longer apply.
- 2026-09-01 -- Registered the exact bounded composition-lineage extension,
  child-parameter-v2 purpose/schema separation, and linearizable ledger
  authorization-read rules. Preserved snapshot-v1 unknown-extension
  compatibility and historical child-parameter-v1 conformance without granting
  either stronger authority by reinterpretation.
- 2026-08-31 -- Established the integrated `crates/suprnova-live/` subtree as
  the sole maintained product, specification, checker, browser, fixture, test,
  benchmark, and implementation-document authority. The former standalone
  checkout is immutable historical provenance; its reference catalog and Fable
  ZIP remain non-normative. Updated commands to run from the Suprnova root with
  explicit Live package and browser paths. This cutover does not claim the
  public facade, routes, providers, CLI, or RenderCache complete, and the
  outstanding Iteration 004 release qualification remains blocking.
- 2026-08-30 -- Advanced the active contract to iteration 005 for the atomic
  Suprnova workspace cutover and the complete RenderCache foundation assigned by
  iteration 004. The committed engine, browser, fixtures, tests, specs, checker,
  and implementation documentation move together; after cutover the integrated
  subtree is the sole maintained authority. Outstanding iteration-004 release
  qualification remains visible and cannot be converted into success by the
  repository move.
- 2026-08-29 -- Recorded the completed Iteration 004 artifact and protocol
  facts: fixture corpus v4, upload and async protocol v1, feature-registry ABI
  v1, asset-manifest schema v2, runtime contract v1, and optional capabilities
  `uploads@1`/`async@1` alongside `core@1`/`stimulus@1`. These are standalone
  development and conformance contracts, not Suprnova route, provider, scanner,
  storage, or broadcaster integration.
- 2026-08-26 -- Appended the reviewed Task 7 measurements in a separate commit
  after their producing code and policy decision became immutable at
  `57eb8c260abe44f9aacd8c2cc03b1a54f3ceec61`. The checker verifies strict source
  ancestry, the decision marker in that source commit, and every valid prior
  history prefix; it cannot self-approve a candidate or rewrite provenance.
- 2026-08-26 -- Corrected reviewed-baseline provenance to require a strictly
  prior immutable source commit and decision record before a later append. A
  candidate hash change alone is not drift; exact stored hashes authenticate
  historical reviewed artifacts, while the 15-percent size rule reports only
  unreviewed growth. The circular Task 7 entry was withdrawn, Task 6 remains
  active during the two-commit correction, and correctness-driven growth has no
  absolute transfer veto.
- 2026-08-26 -- Previously advanced the async artifact baseline through an
  explicit independent Task 7 review. The measurements and rationale remain
  review evidence, but the newer decision corrects its circular provenance.
  The closed schema retains the immutable Task 6 anchor and continues to treat
  15 percent as an alert between valid reviewed baselines.
  Production-build hooks use isolated temporary output roots and an explicit
  30-second timeout; only tests that must mutate shared `dist/` bytes serialize
  behind the cross-process lock, rather than inflating unrelated test limits.
- 2026-08-26 -- Removed the async artifacts' arbitrary 16 KiB total-size
  ceiling. Exact ESM/classic Brotli measurement remains mandatory; a separate
  closed-provenance Task 6 baseline gates only unreviewed growth greater than 15
  percent, and no command automatically writes or derives that baseline from the
  current candidate.
- 2026-08-26 -- Ordinary clean-checkout browser budgets always reproduce and
  hash the production artifacts and enforce each role's approved absolute or
  reviewed-drift policy without requiring ignored local benchmark evidence.
  Explicit binding mode and release mode require a fresh artifact-matched
  candidate with at least three independent runs and compare it only with the
  prior approved performance baseline.
- 2026-08-25 -- Separated the approved binding browser benchmark from ignored
  candidate measurements. In explicit binding or release mode, the current
  production artifact is measured into a distinct candidate file and compared
  with the prior approved baseline under the 15-percent confirmation policy; an
  artifact hash mismatch is reported rather than "fixed" by self-baselining.
  The runner rejects identical baseline/output paths, and replacing the binding
  baseline requires explicit approval plus independent evidence.
- 2026-08-24 -- Approved exact `imagesize` 0.15.0 with default features disabled
  and only PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP dimension probes enabled. The 2026-08-24 provenance
  review recorded MIT licensing, no normal transitive dependencies, upstream
  source/docs, and no matching RustSec advisory found at review time; lockfile,
  license inventory, MSRV, hostile-regression, and dedicated fuzz checks remain
  required before acceptance.
- 2026-08-24 -- Split Iteration 004 performance execution by purpose: ordinary
  unattended gates run reduced deterministic workload proofs, while explicit
  release mode runs the full qualified `U4/16`, `E100/1K`, and `R100` matrices.
  Both paths remain mechanical and release mode cannot silently substitute smoke
  evidence for pinned `S1`/`B1` qualification.
- 2026-08-24 -- Replaced the arbitrary absolute core-runtime transfer cap with
  deterministic ESM/classic size reporting and exact-artifact benchmark
  rebaselining. Optional artifact ceilings remain enforced; a future core ceiling
  requires completed functionality, evidence, and explicit maintenance headroom.
- 2026-08-24 -- Clarified that a Stimulus-free universal core excludes both the
  third-party package and Suprnova's optional bridge implementation. Added the
  trusted Stimulus adapter role, unchanged boot contract, and ESM/classic
  no-bundler parity to the deterministic artifact convention.
- 2026-08-23 -- Advanced the active contract to iteration 004 as one complete
  standalone upload and asynchronous-update foundation across specs 08 and 14.
  Kept upload and event protocols distinct over shared bounded-resource
  lifecycle machinery; split upload/async into manifest-selected optional
  ESM/classic artifacts to preserve a small universal core; required
  provider, continuity, adversarial, and hard resource-budget evidence; and
  retained storage/broadcast framework adapters for the later atomic Suprnova
  integration.
- 2026-08-22 -- Advanced the active contract to iteration 003 as one complete
  standalone browser interaction runtime across specs 09 through 13. Retained
  vertical implementation milestones inside the single contract; rejected both
  splitting a coherent runtime into artificial numbered partial products and
  calling a bootstrap-only shell complete. `agent-browser` and DevTools MCP may
  assist exploratory diagnosis, while committed Playwright, shared-fixture, and
  benchmark evidence remain the completion authority.
- 2026-08-21 -- Locked standalone macro expansion to final
  `::suprnova::live` paths and required a dev-only facade fixture, preventing
  successful development builds from concealing public integration drift.
- 2026-08-21 -- Advanced the active contract to iteration 002 and kept its
  server-component kernel standalone. Conformance host adapters are test
  apparatus, not actual Suprnova integration; the latter waits for the atomic
  code/spec/checker move.
- 2026-08-21 -- Added checked nested iteration contracts to the structural and
  optional handoff-archive gates; `iterations/NNN.md` is normative scope while
  `iterations/next/` remains unconfirmed capture.
- 2026-08-21 -- Applied the house warning policy: Clippy findings are reviewed
  without blanket `-D warnings`, and intentional suppressions are scoped and
  reasoned rather than hidden by broad allowances.
- 2026-08-21 -- Reserved the top-level spec directory for the checked canonical
  set; supplemental normative documents live in linked subdirectories and must
  be added to the checker/archive contract deliberately.
- 2026-08-21 -- Kept iteration 001 development, normative specifications, and
  the checker colocated in this dedicated workspace. Migration into Suprnova is
  triggered only by a material integration/testing/coherence blocker and then
  moves code, specs, and checker together; reference sources and the optional
  Fable handoff ZIP remain non-normative development artifacts.
- 2026-08-21 -- Established one internal engine crate with public framework,
  macro, CLI, dogfood, and browser/component integration points; rejected
  application dependencies on internal crates.
- 2026-08-21 -- Chose strict TypeScript and reproducible npm scripts for runtime
  contribution while shipping prebuilt artifacts so application adoption needs
  no JavaScript toolchain.
- 2026-08-21 -- Made Tier 0 the provider semantic reference and the architecture
  budgets release-blocking rather than advisory.
- 2026-08-21 -- Mirrored Suprnova's no-unsafe, documented-public-API, typed-error,
  targeted-test, full-gate, and non-concurrent-build rules.
