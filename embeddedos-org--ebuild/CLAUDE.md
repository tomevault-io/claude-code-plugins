# Agent Responsibilities

Each role owns a slice of the work and does only that slice. Full briefs are in
[.ai/](./.ai/). These are responsibilities, not a required agent count — one
agent may hold several roles on a small change. Split when the roles need
genuinely different context, not by default.

One rule is structural rather than stylistic: **whoever implements does not
approve.** Review is a separate role because self-review reliably misses the
thing the implementer already believes is correct.

## Repository map

- `ebuild/` is the Python package. Keep CLI wiring in `ebuild/cli/`, backend
  selection and execution in `ebuild/build/`, dependency and package behavior
  in `ebuild/deps/` and `ebuild/packages/`, and image or firmware workflows in
  `ebuild/system/` and `ebuild/firmware/`.
- `core/` contains vendored native EoS and eBoot components. Changes there need
  the component's CMake tests in addition to the Python suite.
- `recipes/`, `layers/`, `hardware/`, and `templates/` are user-facing build
  inputs. Preserve their schemas and add a focused parser, resolver, or
  generated-output test when behavior changes.
- `docs/` is the MkDocs source. `docs/wiki/` mirrors the six published GitHub
  Wiki pages; keep those pages aligned when their shared guidance changes.
- `tests/ebuild/` and `tests/unit/` cover the Python tool, while
  `tests/functional/`, `tests/performance/`, and native `core/**/tests/` cover
  broader behavior. Do not use `tests_backup/` as the validation target.

## Working in this repository

1. Read `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the nearest component files before
   editing. Keep changes within the requested subsystem.
2. Install the Python development environment with
   `python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"` when dependencies are not already
   available.
3. Run focused tests for the changed behavior, then run
   `python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` when the environment supports the
   full suite.
4. Run `ruff check .` for Python changes. For native changes, configure with
   `cmake -S . -B build -DEOS_BUILD_TESTS=ON`, build with `cmake --build build`,
   and run `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure`.
5. Validate changed YAML and Markdown with the repository tooling, and always
   run `git diff --check` before committing.
6. Follow the DCO and conventional commit requirements in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
   Pull requests must use a closing keyword such as `Fixes #123` for a real
   issue in this repository.

## Switching roles

Switch when the task changes domain, when specialist knowledge is required,
when independent review is required, or when the context has grown past what
one agent can hold accurately. Every switch runs the protocol in
[HANDOFF.md](./HANDOFF.md).

## Finding work that is not yours

You will. The rule is: **record it, do not absorb it, do not drop it.**

| What you found | Do |
|----------------|-----|
| A defect unrelated to your task | Note it in [TASKS.md](./TASKS.md) and keep going. |
| A defect your change would sit on top of | Stop; say it blocks you; propose fixing it as its own task. |
| A security issue | Report immediately, whatever role you hold. This one never waits for a handoff. |
| A design decision missing from the plan | Return to the architect rather than deciding it inside an implementation. |
| Work that belongs to a role nobody assigned | Say so. An unowned task is how requirements go missing. |

Silently fixing something outside your task makes the diff unreviewable.
Silently ignoring it means nobody ever looks again. Neither is acceptable; the
note is what makes the difference.
