> Run `build.ps1` to build and run all unit tests and validations.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/nuget-catalogreader/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

## Build and test

### Windows

Run `build.ps1` to build and run all unit tests and validations.

### Linux

Run `build.sh` to build and run all unit tests and validations.

## Rules

All builds and tests must pass successfully before stopping. All errors or test failures must be fixed.

## Project setup

* Package versions are managed centrally in `Directory.Packages.props`, do not add versions to `PackageReference` items.
* Shared build settings are in `build/common.props` and `build/test.props`, projects import one of them before `Sdk.props`.
* Tests use xUnit v3 on Microsoft.Testing.Platform with AwesomeAssertions. Pass `TestContext.Current.CancellationToken` to async APIs called from tests.

## Style

Follow existing patterns in the repository for both structure, coding style, and tests.

## Release notes

Update ReleaseNotes.md to provide a concise summary of any functionality changes. These notes should be aimed at users. Internal fixes do not need to be noted.
