# release

> Tags are module versions, release asset names are coupled across GoReleaser, the installer, the action and the docs

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/release/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Release

A release is a tag `vX.Y.Z` on `main`. The tag is at once the Go module version
(`go install ...@vX.Y.Z`, a `require` line), the name of the GitHub release
with the binaries, and the ref of the GitHub Action (`uses:
EvilFreelancer/tgfake@vX.Y.Z` installs that same version).

## Coupled names

`.goreleaser.yaml` names the archives `tgfake_<version without v>_<os>_<arch>`
(`.tar.gz`, `.zip` on Windows) with `checksums.txt` beside them, for linux,
darwin and windows on amd64 and arm64. `scripts/install.sh` builds the same
names, `action.yml` calls the installer, and `docs/ci.md` documents them. A
change to one is a change to all four. The first three are exercised before a
tag can exist: the `Release snapshot` job of `ci.yaml` builds every archive,
and the `Install` job runs `scripts/test-install.sh` and the action from a
local mirror of them on Linux, macOS and Windows. `docs/ci.md` is kept in step
by review.

## Cutting one

1. `main` is green (the `CI` gate job).
2. `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
3. `release.yaml` runs the race-detector suite, publishes with GoReleaser, then
   installs the release with the action on Linux, macOS and Windows and talks to
   it.

## Never

- Move, delete or re-push a tag: the Go module proxy has already cached it. Fix a
  bad release with the next patch version.
- Tag a commit that is not on `main` (`release.yaml` refuses it).
- Publish an asset under a name the installer does not build.
- Interpolate an action input into a `run:` script; pass it through `env:`.
