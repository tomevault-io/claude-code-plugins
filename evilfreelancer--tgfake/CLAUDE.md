> Happy paths in features/ with godog, edges in unit tests, through the wire, race-clean

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Testing

Tests are the specification of the server. A change starts with the test that
shows it missing.

- **Happy path in `features/`.** A new capability gets a scenario in a
  `features/*.feature` file describing it working, with step definitions in a
  `bdd_*_test.go` of the package that owns it (`Options.Paths` relative to that
  package, `Strict: true`). The command's own story is
  `features/command.feature`, run against `run()` in `cmd/tgfake`.
- **Edges in unit tests.** Refusals, limits and odd input are ordinary tests
  next to the code, asserting both the HTTP status and Telegram's description.
- **Through the wire.** Server tests talk HTTP to a `newStand` (`httptest` plus
  a short `MaxPollWait`) the way a bot library does - `s.call`, `s.callToken`,
  `s.sim` - and read state back through the public view (`Chat`, `Calls`).
- **No sleeps where a signal exists.** Wait on `WaitCall`, a channel or a
  bounded poll; move time through `s.now` instead of sleeping past a deadline.
- **Clean shutdown.** Close the server before its `httptest.Server`, so held
  long polls do not stall the listener.
- **Race-clean.** `make check` runs golangci-lint and `go test -race` over
  everything; CI runs the same on Linux and the plain suite on macOS and
  Windows, plus Go 1.22.
- **Examples are tested.** `examples/echobot` is part of `go test ./...`;
  `examples/shell/bot-e2e.sh` runs in CI against the binary the action installs.
