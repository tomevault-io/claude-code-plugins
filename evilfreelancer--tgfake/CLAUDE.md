# Telegram fidelity

The server exists so a bot meets in a test what it will meet in a chat. Every
Bot API method behaves the way api.telegram.org does, including how it fails.

## What "the same" means

- **Same answers.** The envelope is `{"ok": true, "result": ...}` or
  `{"ok": false, "error_code": N, "description": "..."}` with the HTTP status
  equal to `error_code` (`writeResult`, `writeError` in `pkg/server/methods.go`).
  A 429 carries `parameters.retry_after`.
- **Same refusals, same words.** When Telegram refuses a call, the server refuses
  it with Telegram's own description, copied from a real answer or from the Bot
  API documentation (`Bad Request: message is not modified: ...`,
  `Bad Request: BUTTON_DATA_INVALID`, `Bad Request: query is too old and response
  timeout expired or query ID is invalid`). A bot that matches on the text must
  work against both. Never invent a friendlier message.
- **Same state rules.** Update ids only grow, across `Reset` too; `offset`
  confirms updates and a negative one counts from the end; `allowed_updates` is
  remembered between polls and applied when an update is created; a callback
  query takes exactly one answer; a draft expires 30 s after its last revision;
  `typing` shows for 5 s.
- **Stricter only on purpose.** The one deliberate difference is a button with
  more than one action, which Telegram reads as its first and the server refuses.
  Any new deviation is documented in `docs/bot-api.md` with its reason.

## Adding or changing a method

1. Find the method in the Bot API documentation and, when possible, the answer
   Telegram gives for each failure the bot can cause.
2. Add the case to the switch in `serveBotAPI` (lower-cased name) and a handler
   that reads parameters through `params` (query, form, JSON and multipart all
   arrive there) and answers through `writeResult` / `writeError`, so the call is
   filed in the outbox and faults apply to it.
3. Keep chat state behind `s.mu`; a helper that expects the lock ends in
   `Locked`. Read time through `s.now`, never `time.Now`, so tests can move it.
4. When the person would see the effect, put it in the `ChatView` (and the text
   form `ChatView.Text`) so the simulation API and the chat page show it.
5. Wire types go to `pkg/botapi` with the Bot API's JSON names; stateless Mini
   App logic goes to `pkg/webapp`.
6. Tests: the happy path in a `features/*.feature` scenario when it is a new
   capability, every refusal as a unit test asserting status and description.
7. Document the method in `docs/bot-api.md` (row, refusals) and, if the person
   can trigger it, in `docs/sim-api.md`.

## Never

- Accept input Telegram rejects because a bot under test happens to send it.
- Add a dependency outside test files; the packages are standard library only.
- Add behaviour that only one client needs as a default; make it an option.
