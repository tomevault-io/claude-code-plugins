# docs

> README and docs/ carry every user-visible change, checked against the code

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/docs/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Documentation

`README.md` is the landing page; `docs/` is the reference, one page per
surface: `command.md`, `bot-api.md`, `sim-api.md`, `mini-apps.md`,
`scripted-model.md`, `go.md`, `ci.md`, `development.md`.

- A change that a user can see carries its documentation in the same commit: a
  method, a refusal, a route, a flag, an option field, an action input.
- Every statement is checked against the code; an example is run before it is
  written down.
- Images live in `docs/assets/` and every file there is referenced by a page.
- English prose, a spaced hyphen " - " instead of an em dash, straight quotes,
  no emoji, no horizontal rules. Code blocks name their language.
- Links between pages are relative; links to sources are relative to `docs/`.
