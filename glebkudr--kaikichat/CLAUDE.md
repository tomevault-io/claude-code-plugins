Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

# Agent guide

**Machine-specific rules first.** If `AGENTS.local.md` exists in the
repository root, read it before any build, check, release or deployment. It
is not part of Git (see `.gitignore`) and names this machine's paths, disks,
toolchains, keys, servers and what the owner allows without asking; where it
is more specific than this file, it wins. Never commit it, and never copy its
contents into tracked files.

**Never delete recursively outside the working directory.** No `rm -rf`
outside the repository checkout or the worktree the task runs in: not in
`/tmp`, the home directory, other checkouts or other volumes. The same holds
for any other recursive deletion (`rm -r`, `find … -delete`,
`shutil.rmtree` and the like). Leave temporary files outside the working
directory in place, or ask the owner. State this rule in the task of every
subagent you start.

# Storage and builds

Every build and check goes through `scripts/build-storage.py`: it checks where
the heavy build data lives, sets the tool and cache paths and starts the
command. Pick its profile explicitly: `mac-apfs` (the default) on macOS,
`portable-linux` on Linux.

## The mac-apfs profile

The heavy build directories (see Placement rules) are symlinks into a
dedicated APFS volume attached from a disk image. `.local/build-storage.json`
(not in Git) describes it:

- `image`, `mount`, `volume_uuid`: the sparse bundle, where it is attached
  and the UUID the volume must have;
- `directory` (optional): this checkout's directory on the volume, when
  several checkouts share one image; the volume's root otherwise;
- `path`, `env`: the project's toolchains put first on `PATH`, and variables
  such as `AIN_NODE`, `AIN_FOUNDRY_BIN`, `AIN_SOLC`.

## Commands

Run from the repository root.

```sh
python3 scripts/build-storage.py mount          # Attach the image without starting a build
python3 scripts/build-storage.py check          # Verify the volume and symlinks without attaching anything
python3 scripts/build-storage.py setup          # Restore empty directories and missing symlinks
python3 scripts/build-storage.py install        # Restore npm from the lock file inside the image
python3 scripts/build-storage.py run node scripts/build-desktop.mjs
python3 scripts/build-storage.py run scripts/check.sh
python3 scripts/build-storage.py run node scripts/check-native.mjs
python3 scripts/build-storage.py run node scripts/check-network.mjs
```

The same format applies to individual commands:
`python3 scripts/build-storage.py run COMMAND...`.
`run` attaches the image automatically; there is no need to run `mount`
separately each time. The built release app:
`target/release/bundle/macos/Kaiki Chat.app`.

### Explicit portable profile for Linux

On Linux work in the root of the current checkout and always choose the
profile explicitly:

```sh
python3 scripts/build-storage.py --profile portable-linux setup
python3 scripts/build-storage.py --profile portable-linux doctor --suite build-tooling
python3 scripts/build-storage.py --profile portable-linux run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/build -p 'test_build_evidence.py' -v
python3 scripts/build-storage.py --profile portable-linux --output output/build-evidence-001 run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/build -p 'test_build_evidence.py' -v
```

`portable-linux` is available only on Linux. It uses `target`, `output`,
`cache` and `.local/verification-workspaces` of the current checkout and never
calls APFS, `diskutil` or `hdiutil`. These paths and their parents inside the
checkout must be ordinary directories: any symlinks are rejected before
directories are created or anything is written, and are left untouched.
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` must point at the target of this checkout;
`CARGO_BUILD_TARGET` and `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET_DIR` are forbidden. The profile
mounts no images and installs no dependencies. The `run` command starts the
child process from the absolute root of the checkout. With `--output` it saves
a command log and `check.json`; a new attempt needs a new directory. Without
`--output` a plain exec is recorded.

The default profile is `mac-apfs`: a missing `.local/build-storage.json`,
volume or utilities, or a UUID/APFS/image/symlink mismatch remains an error,
including for `check`. The presence of Linux or the absence of the Mac config
does not enable portable automatically. The wrapper passes the chosen profile
to the nested first-party scripts through `AIN_BUILD_STORAGE_PROFILE`; those
scripts again name `--profile` explicitly. `build-storage.py` itself does not
choose the profile from an environment variable.

Doctor checks only the selected suite and reports `passed`, `failed`,
`blocked` or `unsupported`; it is a preflight, not product acceptance. The
Python suites need no Cargo, frontend-unit needs no Tauri/Foundry,
native-macos is unavailable on Linux. native-runtime has only a runtime phase:
Python, Git and local Unix IPC for daemon scenarios, without Cargo/Foundry.
Doctor does not check `AIN_SOLC`. Doctor does not check the mac-apfs tools
outside Darwin and returns `unsupported`. `build-desktop.mjs` seals into
`output/desktop-build/<run>/prepared-artifacts.json` the sources/ref, locks,
the build configuration (including recursive Cargo `include`) and the
artifacts. It is a record for review: nothing reuses it later. The offline
toolkit and its safe layout are described in
`tests/build/README-linux-toolkit.md`: npm, GTK 3, both lock files and the
full checksum-bound frontend payload are mandatory. Using it requires no
Docker.

### Access to system utilities from a sandbox

- For diagnostics use the regular paths:
  `/usr/sbin/diskutil info -plist <mount>` and
  `/usr/bin/hdiutil info -plist`. The error `command not found` is about
  `PATH`; the error `Unable to run because unable to use the DiskManagement
  framework` means the utility ran but got no access to the system framework.
  These are different causes; changing the path or reinstalling the utility
  does not fix the second one.
- In a sandbox a DiskManagement/DiskArbitration error is possible with an
  already attached healthy volume. `/sbin/mount` and `hdiutil info -plist`
  help confirm the attachment and the image path, but they do not replace the
  wrapper's UUID and symlink checks. Do not declare the disk missing or broken
  based on that error alone.
- If the current task and the session policy allow widening access, on that
  error rerun `python3 scripts/build-storage.py check` from the repository
  root through `exec_command` with
  `sandbox_permissions: "require_escalated"` and a justification of
  DiskManagement access for verifying the build storage. This is the regular
  way to request execution outside the sandbox, not running via `sudo`; the
  permission mechanism decides. If widening is forbidden or the request is
  declined, report the exact reason for the block and do not work around it.
- After a successful check, run the whole command you need through
  `python3 scripts/build-storage.py run COMMAND...` in the same permitted
  mode. A separate successful `check` outside the sandbox does not grant
  access to a later `run` inside the sandbox: every wrapper run talks to
  `diskutil` again.
- On an access error do not re-attach an already attached image, do not run
  `setup`/`install` to fix it and do not disable the APFS/UUID/image/symlink
  checks. Do not move the build to the internal disk and do not run it
  outside the wrapper.

Before detaching the image, finish builds, tests and apps launched from it,
then run `python3 scripts/build-storage.py unmount`; never force it. When the
volume is missing or the APFS/UUID/image/symlinks do not match, stop and
restore the attachment; do not bypass the check. After a sudden disconnect
restart the build; if damaged, the build data is what gets recreated, keeping
the sources.

## Releases and deployment

Production builds from `main` of
[glebkudr/kaikichat](https://github.com/glebkudr/kaikichat): work on a
branch, merge the reviewed result into `main`, push, then deploy
`deploy/docker-compose.yml` with the host's own means. A deployment restarts
every service, the nodes included. Installers and updates of the command line
come from the signed network preset and the archives at
`https://kaikichat.com/downloads` (`scripts/publish-cli.sh`); GitHub Releases
are not the artifact source. The server, the deployment procedure, the keys
and what needs the owner's agreement are in `AGENTS.local.md`. Spending on
the blockchain (deployments, bonds, purchases, gas top-ups) always needs the
owner.

Every macOS binary of a release is signed with the owner's Developer ID
before it is published, never only with the linker's ad-hoc signature:

- the desktop app: `scripts/macos-notarize.sh` signs it inside-out,
  notarizes and staples it;
- the command line that `scripts/publish-cli.sh macos-arm64` packs through
  `scripts/pack-cli.sh` (`kaiki`, `kaiki-agentic-node`, `agentic-cli`,
  `agentic-mcp`, and `agentic-node` as a link to the daemon for kaiki 0.2.4
  and older, which check that name before they update):
  `scripts/macos-sign-cli.sh target/release` signs each one with
  `codesign --force --options runtime --timestamp --identifier <identifier> --sign <Developer ID>`,
  choosing the identity as `macos-notarize.sh` does (`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`
  when there are several).

Both take the identifiers from the one table in `scripts/macos-sign-cli.sh`:
`kaiki` and the app's main executable are `net.agenticinternet.desktop`,
`agentic-cli` and `agentic-mcp` are `net.agenticinternet.<name>`, and the
daemon `kaiki-agentic-node` keeps `net.agenticinternet.agentic-node` from
before its file was renamed. An explicit identifier stays the same from
release to release (without it codesign makes one from the file name and a
hash, or the bare file name), so the Keychain keeps trusting an updated
binary. `kaiki` shares the app's identifier because the Keychain lets only
code with the app's identifier and team read the profile key the app keeps
there without the password dialog; its own identifier, the bare file name or
an ad-hoc signature brings the dialog back (measured:
`evidence/reviews/keychain-one-identity-2026-09-30/`). Where macOS still
asks (a key an older signature saved), the window explains the dialog before
it reads the key, and `kaiki` says so on stderr.

Signing stays an explicit release step; `scripts/publish-cli.sh` never signs.
Before packing anything or contacting the server it runs
`scripts/macos-sign-cli.sh --check` on every macOS build it is given, the
app bundle's executables included, and refuses when one is unsigned or
ad-hoc, has no `Authority=Developer ID Application`, another identifier,
another team than the others, no hardened runtime or no secure timestamp, or
fails `codesign --verify --strict`. The release steps, signing included,
are in [Docs/V1_NETWORK_PRESET_2026_09_28_RU.md](Docs/V1_NETWORK_PRESET_2026_09_28_RU.md)
("Releasing"); the identity and the notary profile are in `AGENTS.local.md`.

## Placement rules

- Rust target, npm node_modules, frontend dist, Tauri binaries/gen/permissions,
  Foundry out/cache/broadcast and the shared cache/output use symlinks into
  the image.
- Do not replace these symlinks with real directories. Do not run a plain
  `npm ci` in the sources: it may replace the node_modules symlink; use
  `install` above.
- Do not create heavy targets or verification checkouts in Library/Caches or
  a permanent internal `/tmp` copy. Place temporary worktrees in
  `.local/verification-workspaces`, which points into the image. Run `mount`
  first. Run commands for such a worktree from the main checkout with an
  explicit `--worktree` before `run`, for example
  `python3 scripts/build-storage.py --worktree .local/verification-workspaces/NAME run cargo test --workspace`.
  After the regular check of the volume, UUID, image and symlinks, the wrapper
  requires the path to be the root of a Git checkout strictly inside
  `.local/verification-workspaces`, with its `target` not leading outside the
  worktree. The command then runs from that worktree with
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=<worktree>/target`, including with `--output`; the main
  repository's build is not touched. The relative path is resolved from the
  current directory. Without `--worktree`, `run` always executes in the main
  checkout, so running from a cwd inside `.local/verification-workspaces`
  without this flag is rejected. `--worktree` is supported only for `run` in
  `mac-apfs`.
- Keep unique fixtures and verified evidence in the sources and commit them.
  Do not add builds, run logs, images, secrets or local configs to Git.
- Do not delete `.local/build-storage.json` to bypass the protection. When
  restoring the environment, restore the config first, then use `setup` and
  `install`.

## Fast diagnostic test loop (V1-C05)

Offline message storage and delivery is a swarm of recipient mailboxes
([Docs/V1_STORAGE_REDESIGN_2026_09_24.md](Docs/V1_STORAGE_REDESIGN_2026_09_24.md),
plan and phase status in
[Docs/V1_MAILBOX_SWARM_IMPLEMENTATION.md](Docs/V1_MAILBOX_SWARM_IMPLEMENTATION.md)).
The former custody/history path, A04/H11 and their rigs are removed.

For bug-hunting and reproduction iterations use the accelerated loops instead
of waiting for the ceilings of native runs:

1. First the single-process reproducer with managed time:
   `cargo test --locked -p agentic-node --lib reproducer_tests::` (swarm
   scenarios: `reproducer_tests::mailbox_swarm::`), the `runtime::clock` and
   `mailbox_holder` tests take seconds. Reproduce a new failure class by
   extending the existing rig (`reproducer_tests.rs`,
   `reproducer_mailbox_swarm_tests.rs`), not by a separate rig.
2. The load acceptance spike on the same rig:
   `cargo test --locked -p agentic-node --lib -- --ignored acceptance_spike --nocapture`;
   `AIN_SPIKE_MESSAGES=<n>` reduces the message count. Method and results:
   `evidence/reviews/mailbox-swarm-spike-2026-09-26/`. Keep the rig's virtual
   time separate from real time and from native. The rig's wall clock grows
   only in whole seconds per step: measure durations by
   `rig.clock.instant()`.
3. The native swarm rig appears after phases 1b and 2; until then a rig
   scenario is not native acceptance. Do not scale TTL, quorum, periods or
   message counts for speed.
4. Reading hangs: `node_info.mailboxSwarm` (`sent`/`served`/`failureKinds`,
   `lastFailure`, `notary.waiting`, `grants.checking`, `replication.pulls`)
   and `node_info.mailboxHolder`.
5. Do not fake the system time (faketime/CLOCK_REALTIME) and do not use
   `tokio::time::pause` as a substitute seam. In new scheduler code introduce
   no direct `Instant::now()`/`.elapsed()`: the clock is
   `crate::runtime::clock` (`instant()` for the scheduler loop, `wall()` for
   the protocol), the RNG is `crate::runtime::random::fill`.

For new backend functionality write the tests first; after changing them and
before production code, start a separate context-free backend-test-critic and
wait for its decision. After the implementation, run the backend and frontend
checks. Run visual checks in the background, save and review the screenshots.
Local Docker means OrbStack; do not change neighboring projects' settings.

Automated native E2E must not trigger system keychain password prompts. Use
the debug build with `e2e` and a separate `E2eFileStore` inside a temporary
profile; the keys are deleted with it after the processes stop. Do not create
login Keychain entries for such tests and do not change its global settings or
ACLs. A real `system_keychain_roundtrip` is only a separate, explicitly
allowed interactive run. In the regular build the storage stays the system
Keychain.
