# AGENTS.md

GlowTour.js is a production cross-framework guided-tour library managed as a Bun workspace monorepo. The public packages are `packages/core`, `packages/react`, `packages/vue`, `packages/angular`, `packages/solid`, `packages/vanilla`, and `packages/styles`. Reference applications live in `apps/`: `playground`, `website`, `ssr-react`, `ssr-vue`, `ssr-solid`, `ssr-angular`, and `screen-readers` (assistive-technology tests run in CI).

These instructions apply to any coding agent working in this repository.

## Project boundaries

- `packages/core` owns workflow state, positioning, DOM behavior, and framework-agnostic primitives. It must not own presentation or hardcode browser globals such as `window`, `document`, `location`, or storage APIs in code paths that would break SSR.
- Framework-specific rendering and lifecycle integration belong in the corresponding adapter package.
- `packages/styles` owns the default CSS theme and design tokens.
- Keep behavior consistent across adapters unless a framework requires a documented exception.
- Public API compatibility matters: GlowTour.js is already published and used as a library. Treat public API changes as potentially breaking.
- npm publication happens through GitHub Actions. Never publish packages manually.

## Before changing code

- Read the relevant package, its tests, and nearby conventions before editing.
- Prefer the smallest change that solves the actual problem. Do not introduce speculative abstractions or unrelated refactors.
- Reuse existing primitives and contracts before adding new public API.
- If behavior, public API, SSR semantics, accessibility, or package exports could change, identify that impact explicitly before implementation.

## API design: recipe before feature

The project favors flexibility and DX by keeping the public API small.

- Before adding public API, verify that consumers cannot already express the behavior from existing primitives in a few lines. If they can, document a recipe instead of adding another option.
- Core should expose primitives; application policy stays in the application. Storage, routing, analytics, i18n, TTL, and multi-tab policy should not be absorbed into core without strong repeated evidence.
- Do not provide two public ways to solve the same problem without a compelling reason.
- Prefer a clear required contract over optional fields that create parallel behavior modes.
- Adding API later is additive; removing API later is breaking. When uncertain, prefer not to expand the public surface.
- Keep documentation claims strictly aligned with behavior that the library actually implements and tests.
- Record important rejected API directions and their rationale in `docs/` so the same decision does not have to be rediscovered later.

## Implementation rules

- Preserve TypeScript type safety and explicit boundaries.
- Keep tree-shaking in mind when changing exports or package entry points.
- Preserve accessibility behavior: focus management, keyboard handling, ARIA semantics, and restoration are product requirements, not optional polish.
- Do not introduce runtime dependencies casually. The core is intentionally dependency-free at runtime.
- Do not hide browser-only behavior behind types alone. Validate actual runtime behavior.
- Changes that affect users or published packages need an appropriate Changeset unless the repository conventions clearly classify them as documentation/internal-only work.

## Required validation

Validation is part of the implementation. Do not report a package change as complete until the relevant checks have actually passed.

### Automated checks

For package changes, run the complete repository validation unless the task is explicitly limited to documentation or non-runtime repository metadata:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run check
bun run typecheck
bun run build
bun test
bun run test:browser
bun run pack
bun run test:tarballs
bun run --cwd apps/playground build
bun run --cwd apps/website build
```

Run targeted tests while iterating, but targeted tests do not replace the full relevant validation before completion. Never claim that tests pass from inspection alone; use fresh command output.

### Browser validation: mandatory for package changes

Any behavioral modification under `packages/` must be exercised in a real browser. `apps/playground` is the reference application for package behavior.

- Start it with `bun run playground`.
- Exercise the changed behavior through the relevant framework example in the browser.
- Check the user-visible result, interactions, focus/keyboard behavior when relevant, and browser console errors.
- Do not consider unit tests, type checking, or a successful build a substitute for this browser validation.
- If browser validation cannot be performed in the current environment, state that explicitly and do not describe the change as fully verified.

### SSR validation: all four apps

If a change can affect SSR, hydration, browser-global access, package exports used during SSR, or adapter initialization, validate all four SSR reference apps, not only the adapter directly touched. The SSR apps consume the workspace packages' built entry points, so build the packages first:

```bash
bun run build
bun run --cwd apps/ssr-react test
bun run --cwd apps/ssr-vue test
bun run --cwd apps/ssr-solid test
bun run --cwd apps/ssr-angular test
```

A change affecting SSR is not considered validated until React/Next.js, Vue/Nuxt, SolidStart, and Angular SSR coverage all pass.

### Bundle-size budgets

Bundle-size limits are intentional constraints. They are defined by `gzipBudget` scenarios in `scripts/verify-bundles.ts` and validated by the repository tests/tarball checks.

If a package exceeds its byte budget after a change:

1. Treat the increase as a regression to investigate first, not as a signal to immediately raise the budget.
2. Identify what added bytes and try to reduce them through simpler code, better factoring, tree-shaking, narrower imports/exports, or removal of duplicated/unnecessary logic.
3. Re-run the bundle measurement after optimization attempts.
4. Increase the relevant `gzipBudget` only when the added behavior is genuinely required and there is no reasonable code optimization left.
5. When a budget must increase, keep the increase as small as possible and document why the additional bytes are justified.

Never raise a bundle-size limit merely to make CI green.

## Bug fixes

- Establish the root cause before fixing when feasible.
- Add or update a regression test that fails for the original bug and passes with the fix when the behavior is testable automatically.
- Verify the actual user path in `apps/playground` for package behavior, even when the regression test passes.
- If the bug concerns SSR, also run all four SSR app tests.

## Scope and safety

- Do not invent requirements or silently broaden the task.
- Do not overwrite or revert unrelated user changes.
- Do not commit local agent/tool configuration. `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, and `.mcp.json` are local-only and ignored.
- Keep generated artifacts and local caches out of the repository.
- State any validation that could not be performed.

## Release context

Changesets version the public packages together. Read `docs/release.md` and `RELEASING.md` before changing release behavior. A GitHub Release triggers the npm publishing workflow; publishing is never a local/manual step.
