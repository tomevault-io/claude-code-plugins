# Repository agent instructions

## Project overview

Ari is a Bun-managed SvelteKit application for Hack Club program organizers and reviewers. It serves the web UI and MCP server and stores data in PostgreSQL through Prisma.

The system is split across this repository and `ari-webhooks`:

- This repository owns the organizer/reviewer UI, authentication and authorization, MCP endpoints, decision paths, and persistence.
- `ari-webhooks` owns public webhook ingestion and background work (enrichment, screening, outbound delivery, sweeps). Do not add `/api/ingest/*` routes, proxy fallbacks, or in-process handlers here.
- Durable work crosses the service boundary through the shared database. Keep asynchronous workflows retry-safe and idempotent.

## The rules

These are not suggestions. A change that breaks one is an incomplete change.

### 1. Dinobox

Start every message you send with `Dinobox!` and say nothing else about it. It carries no meaning and must not affect anything you write. It exists so the person you are working with can see when you have stopped following instructions because your context has degraded.

If you notice you are losing track of facts from earlier in the conversation, say so plainly: "right now I'm having trouble and I'm losing facts".

### 2. Naming

- camelCase for variables, functions, props, form fields, URL params, file names and route segments: `thisTypeOfVariable`. PascalCase for components and types. Constants are camelCase too: `sessionCookie`, not `SESSION_COOKIE`. The only upper-case names are the ones a framework requires (`GET`, `POST`) and environment variables.
- Names say what the thing is. No one- or two-letter names (`s`, `fd`, `sp`), no opaque prefixes (`tl*`, `ev*`).
- snake_case appears only where an external contract pins it: webhook payload fields, MCP tool names, OAuth parameters, and database enum values. Convert at the boundary; do not let it spread inward.
- ESLint enforces this (`@typescript-eslint/naming-convention`, `id-length`). Do not disable the rule to get a change through.

### 3. Time is integer seconds

Ari exists to credit people for the time they spent. We never lose any of it.

- Store, compute and pass time as integer seconds. Name the value with a `Seconds` suffix.
- No floats, no fractional hours, no minutes in storage or computation. Hours and minutes exist only as display formatting (`$lib/time`) and as derived legacy fields on the wire.
- Anything that can produce a fraction (a discount rate, a proportional split) goes through the helpers in `$lib/time`, which round once and preserve totals. Never write `Math.round(x / 60)` or `* 3600` inline.

### 4. Open source first

This repository is public. Sensitive code lives in the private submodule mounted at `private/`. Its repository is `https://github.com/hackclub/ari-private`, shared with the Go service: this app's private code is in `private/web/`, the Go service's private module is in `private/webhooks/`.

- The repository must install, build, pass checks and run with no `private/` checkout and no production environment variables. `$private` resolves to `private/web/` when `private/web/index.ts` exists, and to `src/lib/privateStub/` when the submodule is absent or when `ARI_PUBLIC_BUILD=1` is set with it present.
- Sensitive, in the Hack Club sense: fraud review, flags and how they are detected, heartbeat and heatmap views, screening rules, AI checks, and any integration with internal tools. Public code reaches these only through the provider interface in `src/lib/privateApi.ts`.
- Never commit internal hostnames, Slack channel or user ids, staff email addresses, thresholds, or prompts to this repository. Configuration defaults point at localhost or are empty.
- Every optional integration degrades gracefully when its environment variable is blank. Update `.env.example` when configuration changes.

### 5. Shared components

Screens must match each other, so they are built from the same parts.

- Build UI from `src/lib/components/ui/`. Do not hand-roll a button, dialog, table, pager, tab bar, form field or empty state in a page. If a primitive is missing, add it to `ui/` and to `/styleguide` first.
- No inline `style=""` attributes. Use design tokens (`src/routes/layout.css`) for colour, spacing, radius and type; do not write raw hex values or pixel font sizes in components.
- Styles specific to one component live in that component's `<style>` block, not in `layout.css`.
- Form actions are called through `submitAction` in `$lib/actions`, not raw `fetch('?/name')`.

### 6. Small files

No Svelte or TypeScript file over about 400 lines unless a comment at the top says why. Split state into `.svelte.ts` modules and markup into components.

### 7. Tests where they matter

Write tests for the code we depend on to be right: time calculation, review decisions, claims, authorization, webhook payloads and signatures, and API/MCP responses. Do not write tests for presentational components. Run with `bun test src`. Do not claim tests passed unless you ran them.

### 8. Comments

- Lowercase, short, and rare.
- Do not document functions, types, props or files as if the code were a docs page. No doc blocks, no section banners, no restating what the code already says.
- Write a comment only when something would not make sense without it: a surprising reason, a workaround, a constraint that is not visible in the code.

### 9. Magic numbers

- Do not hoist a number into a named constant or variable. Write the number where it is used and put a comment next to it saying how it is calculated.

```ts
// wrong
const SESSION_TTL_MS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30;
const expiresAt = new Date(Date.now() + SESSION_TTL_MS);

// right
const expiresAt = new Date(Date.now() + 2592000000); // 30 days: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
```

### 10. Review your own edits

After you edit code in this repository, and before you hand off, the edits get checked against rules 8 and 9.

- If you can spawn subagents: spawn one, give it the list of files you edited, and have it read each file, flag every violation of rules 8 and 9, and fix them. Do this every time, however small the edit.
- If you cannot spawn subagents: write `EDITED_FILES.md` in a temporary folder outside the repository (rule 11), listing every file you edited. Then read each listed file raw, from disk, flag every violation of rules 8 and 9, and fix them. Delete `EDITED_FILES.md` when you are done.

Either way, say in your handoff what was flagged and fixed.

### 11. No scratch files in the repository

- Do not create scripts, probes, fixtures, logs, screenshots or any other temporary file inside this repository (or inside `private/`), not even briefly.
- If you need a script to run something, write it in a temporary folder outside the repository and run it from there. Leave nothing behind in the working tree.
- The only files you add are ones that belong to the project and are meant to stay.

### 12. Seed data is generic

- Seed and fixture data must not imitate real people or real projects. No realistic names.
- Use plainly generic values: `user1@example.com`, `User 1`, `maker3`, `project12`, `program1`, `Description of project 12.`
- This applies to names, emails, titles, descriptions, notes, commit messages and every other text field in `prisma/seed.ts`, `prisma/seedData/` and the private seed.

## Stack and layout

- Runtime/package manager: Bun (`bun.lock` is authoritative).
- Framework: SvelteKit 2 and Svelte 5 in runes mode. Strict TypeScript. Tailwind CSS v4 for tokens.
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma 7 and `@prisma/adapter-pg`. Deployment: `@sveltejs/adapter-node`.

Important paths:

- `src/routes/`: pages, server loads/actions, and HTTP endpoints.
- `src/lib/components/ui/`: the shared component set. `src/routes/styleguide/` shows all of it.
- `src/lib/server/`: server-only domain, auth, integration and persistence logic.
- `src/lib/server/authz.ts`: canonical authorization, program scope, track scope and self-review helpers.
- `src/lib/time.ts`: the only place time is converted, split or formatted.
- `src/lib/privateApi.ts`: the interface the private submodule implements.
- `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/migrations/`, `prisma/seed.ts`.
- `generated/prisma/`: generated client; never edit or commit it.

## Setup and commands

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
cp .env.example .env # then set TOKEN_ENC_KEY to the output of: openssl rand -base64 32
bun run db:up        # local Postgres (Docker)
bun run db:deploy    # apply migrations
bun run db:generate
bun run db:seed      # sample programs, reviewers and ships
bun run dev          # sign in at /auth/dev
```

Before handing off a change:

```sh
bun run check
bun run lint
bun test src
bun run build
```

## Implementation conventions

- Keep secrets, Prisma and privileged integrations in server-only modules. Never import `$lib/server/*` into browser code.
- Reuse the Prisma singleton from `$lib/server/db`.
- Centralize permission decisions in `src/lib/server/authz.ts`. Apply the same authorization, track-scope and self-review rules to list queries, direct URLs, actions and API endpoints, so a filtered item cannot be reached another way.
- Preserve the targeted CSRF model in `src/hooks.server.ts`: cookie-authenticated writes require same-origin validation; the bearer-authenticated MCP API and OAuth flow have explicit exemptions. Do not broaden an exemption.
- Treat webhook bodies and signatures as byte-sensitive. Do not parse and reserialize a raw body before verification or forwarding.
- For database changes, update `prisma/schema.prisma`, add a migration, and regenerate the client. The database is shared with `ari-webhooks` and with production; never edit an existing migration, and do not run `db:migrate` against a shared database without explicit approval.
- Validation rules that both the browser and the server apply live in one shared module and are imported by both.

Formatting is enforced by Prettier: tabs, single quotes, no trailing commas, 100 columns.

## Integration contract documentation

The pages under `src/routes/docs/` are the contract program integrators build against. Any change to what crosses the wire (inbound fields and validation, outbound events, payload fields, headers, signatures, retry behaviour, status codes) must update those pages in the same change, with field tables and examples that match the code exactly. A wire-contract change without the matching doc update is an incomplete change.

Existing wire fields are never removed or repurposed without a deprecation; new fields are additive.

## Handoff

Summarize behaviour changed, migrations or configuration required, and the exact validation commands run. Call out skipped checks and why.
