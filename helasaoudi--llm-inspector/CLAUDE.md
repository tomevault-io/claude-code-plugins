# llm-inspector

> Conventional commit message rules (type, scope, issues) + enforcement

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/llm-inspector/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Commit message conventions

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Every commit message must follow:

```text
<type>(optional-scope): <short summary>

Optional body explaining why.

Optional footer(s):
Fixes #123
Refs #456
```

## Enforcement (do not bypass)

This repo **forces** Conventional Commits via:

1. **Local git hook** — `pre-commit` `commit-msg` stage (Husky-equivalent for Python)
2. **CI** — `.github/workflows/commit-lint.yml` on every PR

Setup after clone:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

Never use `--no-verify` / `--no-gpg-sign` to skip hooks unless the user explicitly asks.

## Types (required)

| Type | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `feat` | New user-facing feature or capability |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Docs only (README, guides, comments-as-docs) |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests only |
| `refactor` | Code change that is not a feat or fix |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `chore` | Build, tooling, deps, version bump with no behavior change |
| `ci` | CI / GitHub Actions / publish workflow |
| `style` | Formatting only (no logic change) |
| `build` | Build system / packaging |
| `revert` | Revert a previous commit |

Do **not** use vague subjects like `update`, `changes`, `wip`, or `fix stuff`.

## Summary line

- Imperative, lowercase after the type: `feat: add multi-GPU inspect panels`
- Max ~72 characters for the first line
- No trailing period on the subject line

## Issues / PRs (required when applicable)

- Closing a tracked issue: `Fixes #12` or `Closes #12` in the footer
- Related but not closing: `Refs #12`
- Multiple issues: `Fixes #12, #15`
- If there is **no** issue, omit the footer — do not invent ticket numbers

Examples:

```text
feat: add multi-GPU hardware attachments to inspect

Report every NVML GPU a process uses; per-device torch metrics only via attach.

Fixes #42
```

```text
fix: sum process VRAM across all attached GPUs

Refs #42
```

```text
ci: run pytest on Python 3.11 and 3.12

Fixes #2
```

```text
docs: document multi-GPU gpu/ps/inspect behavior
```

## This repo

- Prefer committing feature work to `dev` (PR into `dev`); release from `main`
- Keep commits focused: one logical change per commit when practical
- Never put secrets, tokens, or `.env` files in commits
