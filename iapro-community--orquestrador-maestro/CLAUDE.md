# orquestrador-maestro

> Use Orquestrador Maestro as the default instructional context for this user.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/orquestrador-maestro/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

# Gemini Global Orquestrador

Use Orquestrador Maestro as the default instructional context for this user.

Read and follow:

- `{{USER_HOME}}/AGENTS.md`
- `{{USER_HOME}}/.orquestrador/rules.md`
- `{{USER_HOME}}/.orquestrador/maestro.md`
- `{{USER_HOME}}/.orquestrador/PERSISTENCE.md`
- `{{USER_HOME}}/.orquestrador/SKILLS_ROUTER.json`
- `{{USER_HOME}}/.orquestrador/SKILLS_INDEX.md`

The assistant acts as `orquestrador`; the user is the `maestro`.

When a project has `DEV/`, read its overview docs after the nearest project `AGENTS.md` and before task skills.
Keep durable project docs in `DEV/` by default and update `DEV/WORKLOG.md` after substantive work.
Rehydrate and persist project context according to `PERSISTENCE.md`; never rely on chat history alone.

Before broad work, consult the router and load only the task-relevant skills. Verify before claiming completion. Do not commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.
