Internal tracking shared by the marketing site and dashboard.

- Seed one Umami website named `nibrun` for marketing and dashboard tracking.
- Keep both sites on the same Umami website. Derive its ID from `src/config.ts`
  in clients and seeding; separate websites cannot form one native funnel.
- `www` and `dashboard` identify the emitting site inside the shared collection.
- Require `VITE_UMAMI_HOSTNAME` at build time; do not add a hostname fallback.
- Declare Vite environment types in `src/vite-env.d.ts`, without local casts.
- Keep the browser's Distinct ID stable across sites and sign-in. Changing it
  during authentication splits Umami sessions and breaks conversion funnels.
- Attach the opaque account ID as Umami session data and custom event data, and
  clear it on sign-out. Never send names or emails. Persist the pre-sign-in
  identity state across OAuth so completed sign-ins can distinguish anonymous
  upgrades from visitor logins.
- Use Umami's automatic SPA tracking and documented `data-before-send` hook.
  Add a navigation fallback only for a verified gap in the pinned tracker.
- Gate tracking through `trackingAllowed()`, including custom events. Preserve
  production-host, HTTPS, top-level-window and Do Not Track restrictions.
- Preserve URL hashes in pageviews, custom events and performance payloads.
  Hash navigation is a pageview; deduplicate by origin, pathname and hash.
- Sanitize every outgoing payload. Exclude credentials, query values, referrer hashes,
  app names, custom hostnames, file paths, prompt contents, configuration values
  and raw errors. Opaque app and attempt IDs may correlate events; settings
  events carry changed field names only.
- Define event contracts in `src/events.ts`; derive callers' types from them.
  Keep acquisition context separate from the preset actually deployed.
- Record outcomes after confirmation. Deployment success requires observed
  `running`; sign-in requires an account session; app claims require the same
  anonymous app to become permanent in that account. Browser events cannot
  guarantee outcomes after the page closes.
- Keep initialization in a `.ts` hook. Add `.tsx` files only when they contain JSX.
