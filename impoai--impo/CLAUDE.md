# Impo contributor instructions

- Keep product copy and documentation in English.
- Use "personal agent" for Impo in product copy, marketing, accessibility labels and store listings. Preserve required protocol role values and existing API identifiers.
- Write every commit message and all code, pull request, and review comments entirely in English. Do not include Chinese or any other language.
- Keep a short dated entry in `WORK_LOG.md` for completed work and validation.
- Read `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and the relevant platform guide.
- Keep platform boundaries: `ios/`, `android/`, `server/`, `contracts/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`.
- Use the root npm workspace commands for installation and verification.
- Keep all provider secrets on the server. Local `.env`, signing files and build output stay untracked.
- The client uses the Impo API for commands and server-issued S3 URLs for audio uploads. An HTTP stream is a subscription, not the lifetime of a run.
- Enforce user ownership on every conversation, task, recording, file and device request.
- Generated product content comes from a Rebyte Agent. Keep model calls out of API request handlers.
- Use `@rebyteai/agent-sdk` and `client.beta.agents`; keep provider protocol separate from the client API.
- Drizzle entities are the schema source of truth. During development use `npm run db:push`; do not create migration histories.
- Keep ordinary execution separate from scheduled triggers. Temporal owns durable background coordination.
- Preserve native permission boundaries. Empty HealthKit results are unknown, not evidence of denial or zero activity.
- Preserve the existing paper/forest-green design, readable type, safe areas and accessible touch targets.
- Regenerate the Xcode project from `ios/App/project.yml` when adding native files.
- Verify changed behavior with relevant tests. Simulator checks do not replace physical microphone, location or background validation.
- Android and Web are implemented; keep physical-device and deployed-account validation limits explicit. Read `web/README.md` for browser support and native-only capabilities. Do not present prototype settings as implemented features.
