# Repository agent contract

## Source ownership

- `app.py` is the macOS menu-bar and py2app application entrypoint. Its
  long-lived process still owns background timers and process-lifetime macOS
  access; menu visibility is not a prerequisite for those jobs. Keep shared
  domain behavior in `core/` rather than making menu presentation its owner.
- `mcp_server.py` is the direct FastMCP entrypoint.
- MCP is an optional legacy read-only compatibility surface. It may query and
  summarize, but must not mutate bookmarks/groups or touch WeChat UI. The old
  send tool names are inert `mcp_send_retired` stubs; legacy send config keys
  remain loadable but inactive. Do not restore sender/policy/confirmation
  modules or a send-side effect path. Ordinary app installation and startup
  must not require the MCP SDK, probe MCP readiness/processes, or manage an MCP
  client. `requirements-mcp.txt` owns the opt-in SDK dependency. Keep explicit
  stdio setup separate and client-neutral; the configured client owns the
  optional server's lifecycle.
- `core/monitor_state.py::MonitorStateStore` is the sole monitor-checkpoint
  write authority. Existing state migrates only after a valid parse; corrupt,
  symlink or non-regular state fails closed. TopicMonitor commits one expected
  revision after successful work and never advances source state after an AI
  failure. A retryable AI failure may CAS-patch only content-free failure
  count/code/timestamps and the bounded backoff deadline against the revision
  that was read; source cursors, inventory bindings and checkpoints must remain
  byte-for-byte unchanged, and a run inside that backoff makes no provider call.
  `core/monitor_source.py` owns the bounded raw-row reader. Canonical progress
  is per chat x logical-shard generation in `source_cursors`; `last_checked_ts`
  is derived compatibility evidence, not source authority. Raw pages merge by
  `create_time` then `source_message_id`, and only actually consumed rows may
  advance tentative cursors. Filtered rows advance without entering an AI
  prompt; `no_messages` requires verified raw EOF under the same complete
  inventory. A generation change or state-revision conflict commits no cursor.
  Knowledge events created before a state conflict reuse their stable
  `source_batch_id` on retry and must not create a second canonical event. If
  that committed event's managed topic Markdown is missing, reuse repairs the
  projection and date indexes without changing canonical event identity.
  Catch-up apply must stop the managed LaunchAgent, acquire the same
  `AppInstanceLock` as the menu app, hold it through backup/drain/projection/
  validation and a durable provisional receipt, release it, and only then
  restore the LaunchAgent. The same `run_id` receipt is atomically finalized
  with the observed restore result; it must not report `complete` while restore
  is pending or after restore failed.
- `core/source_inventory.py::SourceInventoryStore` owns the durable expected
  message-shard set. Logical shard identity is source namespace plus normalized
  relative path; database generation remains separate. Missing, keyless,
  cache-only, unreadable, and changed-generation states must remain explicit.
  Monitor/catch-up may read only a complete inventory. Resource and Direct
  Drive scanners may consume present generations while reporting
  `source_degraded`; they must never relabel that partial observation complete.
- `scripts/health_check.py` is the canonical operator health matrix. Its
  default output is path-free and content-free: no chat identity/body,
  source-relative path, local absolute path, API endpoint, or token. It must
  distinguish monitor healthy/missing/corrupt/conflict, source inventory
  completeness/counts, raw cursor progress, mounted handoff with provider sync
  unknown, separate Direct Drive verification, disabled link preview, legacy
  read-only/send-retired MCP, and the Windows shared storage/credential foundation boundary.
  Health inspection must not scan source, initialize/migrate the source
  inventory, open CAS payload objects, `stat` the protected WeChat container,
  or promote mounted evidence to remote
  verification. Local details require explicit `--sensitive`.
- `setup.py` is the py2app packaging entrypoint. These are the only Python
  files that belong at repository root.
- `core/` owns domain behavior, durable state, privacy boundaries, recovery,
  backup and projection contracts.
- `core/config.py::ConfigStore` is the sole main-config write authority. Writers
  patch the latest locked revision; do not reintroduce whole-snapshot UI/CLI
  saves or non-atomic config writes. `core/app_runtime.py` owns the menu-app
  process singleton.
- `core/url_safety.py` is the sole URL display/export/prompt redaction
  authority. Exact observed URLs and their stable hashes remain unchanged only
  in private durable ledgers. Human-readable projections, snapshots/exports,
  Review Queue, Daily Digest, AI prompts and surfaced errors must use the
  canonical redacted form. The in-process remote link preview path is retired
  and inert: legacy `monitor_fetch_links: true` must still produce
  `link_preview_disabled` with zero network requests. Legacy mounted
  `link_export_mode=full` migrates to `redacted`; only `redacted|off` may be
  selected. Do not add a crawler or another local redaction implementation.
- `ai/` owns provider adapters; `ui/` owns reusable UI components.
- `core/key_extractor.py` owns WeChat build-profile selection, page-one key
  verification and cumulative atomic key-cache publication;
  `c_src/find_keys_macos.c` owns the read-only task-memory scan. Protected-key
  masks are exact version/build/architecture profiles, never guesses. An empty,
  partial or unsupported scan preserves the existing verified cache, and raw
  candidates must not be persisted in logs.
- `scripts/` contains thin operator entrypoints and compatibility cleanup
  commands. Put
  reusable behavior in the owning package rather than duplicating it in a CLI.
  Transient maintenance CLIs that would read the protected WeChat source
  (`refresh_data_source.py`, `catch_up_monitor.py`) must fail closed before any
  source open/stat unless the operator explicitly passes
  `--allow-transient-wechat-source-read`; the flag authorizes only that one
  short-lived process, which may still get its own macOS App Data prompt.
- Source-guard and mounted-resource timers run inside the long-lived py2app
  menu-bar process. macOS App Data consent is process-lifetime access, so their
  retired short-lived LaunchAgent modes must remain no-op cleanup surfaces and
  must not be reintroduced as Python or app-bundle interval workers.
- Explicit resource CLI source operations remain operator entrypoints, but app
  and CLI capture/backfill runs share the resource capture operation lock.
  Historical backfill is staged: plan writes bounded keyset pages and apply
  requires the exact unexpired `run_id`; never restore a confirm-then-rescan
  path. The plan binds `inventory_digest`; apply must reopen the source,
  re-read the exact inventory digest, and fail closed before consuming staged
  rows if the inventory is unavailable, incomplete, or changed.
- `launchers/` owns the canonical Finder-friendly `.command` entrypoints. The
  root `启动.command` is a compatibility stub for deployed source-mode
  LaunchAgents and must not grow a second implementation.
  `launchers/启动.command` builds and validates the ad-hoc-signed local alias
  bundle `dist/WeGroupchatObsidian.app` and launches through that stable bundle
  identity; it must never fall back to a short-lived `python app.py`, and new
  autostart installs bind the same bundle via
  `scripts/autostart.py install --app-bundle`.
- `tests/` is an importable unittest package. New tests belong there and use
  `tests.<module>` for focused invocation.

## Windows port staging

- The full Windows programme contract, `WGO-WIN-SPEC-2`, remains external
  owner-review candidate material. `docs/WINDOWS-PORT-MAP.md` owns the current
  foundation and source seam plus living module/import classification;
  `docs/WINDOWS-DEVELOPMENT.md` owns contributor handoff, phase ordering,
  exact-build evidence and explicit deltas from the historical design.
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` owns the repository-wide contribution entrypoint and public
  evidence boundary; `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and the PR template collect
  task-specific scope and evidence without becoming a second Windows spec.
- `app.py` remains the macOS shell. W0.2B.2 must not add Windows source reads,
  keys, monitor activation, attachment/backup behavior, tray UI, autostart,
  packaging or message sending.
- `core/source_adapter.py` owns the canonical read-source protocol and stateless
  capability/cursor/inventory/page/error helpers. Current `WeChatDB` is the Mac
  implementation; monitor/resource/Direct reuse shared rules without adding a
  durable owner. Keep SourceInventoryStore expected-set and MonitorStateStore
  progress authority intact. `core/source_contract.py` is Markdown provenance,
  not the WeChat reader. Direct scan queue inserts and its new opaque
  `drive_scan_shards.source_cursor_token` commit together; old ledgers gain an
  empty-default column without resetting data or changing remote Drive schema.
  Timestamp-only legacy source callers retain completeness, not a false bounded
  keyset claim. Windows exact schema/key/cache work follows E1 evidence;
  do not infer a Windows source from import success or guess a schema profile.
- `core/platform/` owns platform contracts and fail-closed provider selection.
  W0.2A supplies native locks, W0.2B.1 path identity, and W0.2B.2 private
  storage plus atomic byte publication. W0.3 provides native API/OAuth secret stores;
  notifications/open/autostart/tray/packaging remain W6; source adapters begin
  in W1. `core/keychain.py` is a compatibility facade for current callers; native
  operations live only in `core/platform/macos_secrets.py` and
  `core/platform/windows_secrets.py`. No plaintext API-key fallback. Imported
  database/image key records require exact-source validation in W1.3; current
  Mac key cache and image-config callers remain an explicit compatibility boundary.
- W0.2A migrates direct lock ownership only in `core/config.py`,
  `core/app_runtime.py`, `core/monitor_state.py`, and
  `core/source_inventory.py`. Preserve ConfigStore sole-writer semantics,
  AppInstanceLock process singleton ownership, MonitorState revision CAS, and
  SourceInventory completeness/revision semantics.
- W0.2B.1 distinguishes `display_path`, `operational_path`, `identity_key`, and
  slash-normalized `source_relative_path`. Windows paths are native strings and
  must never pass through POSIX shell unescaping. Initial live identity support
  is local NTFS; UNC remains syntax-only, and reparse points, case-sensitive
  directories, unsupported filesystems/namespaces, root escape, reserved names,
  and trailing-dot/space components fail closed.
- W0.2B.2 migrates only `ConfigStore`, `MonitorStateStore`, and
  `SourceInventoryStore` via `core/state_storage.py`. This binding owns path
  admission and platform IO, never JSON schemas, config revisions, monitor CAS,
  source completeness or logical source identities. The stores retain those
  authorities and their on-disk representations. Atomic writes must secure the
  temporary file before payload bytes, preserve the old target on pre-replace
  failure, and never delete the destination as a replacement fallback.
  Windows privacy requires verified NTFS DACLs; chmod is not evidence.
  Lock preparation must not change an existing state file's permissions before
  its owner validates it; private replacement belongs to the write path.
  Read-only monitor/inventory inspection must not create storage or change
  permissions. Do not migrate archive, knowledge, resource or other storage
  callers implicitly: existing config permission helpers remain solely for
  those current unmigrated consumers.
- `docs/WINDOWS-PORT-MAP.md` is the living module inventory. Every root,
  `ai/`, `core/`, `ui/` and `scripts/` Python module must remain classified,
  and only modules marked `windows-import-safe` enter the Windows import gate.
  Import success is not evidence of Windows feature support.

## Durable and generated boundaries

- SQLite/CAS ledgers are authoritative for durable derived state. Markdown,
  indexes, digests, target views and SVG exports are rebuildable projections.
- Attachment-byte consent is process/session-local and must never be persisted.
  WeChat decrypted caches and source shard/message identities are namespaced by
  source root; plaintext SQLite snapshots use Online Backup so WAL state is not
  lost.
- Source-inventory evidence is path-free and content-free. A mounted snapshot's
  `catalog_complete` marker binds the durable exported catalog only; its
  separate `source_observation.complete` field is the authority for whether the
  current WeChat source set was completely observed.
- Resource projection manifests own generated-path GC. Empty selections still
  render an explicit root; GC may remove only app-owned generated files and must
  hold canonical capture/selection authority, then the DB-scoped backup lock
  plus the real-path-keyed output-root lock. Mounted handoff also takes its
  target-side lock. Distinct capture databases/path aliases cannot concurrently
  own the same projection or mount, and local generated descendants must not
  follow symlinks.
- Editable architecture truth lives in `docs/architecture/*.excalidraw`; SVGs
  under `docs/assets/architecture/` are portable generated exports and must be
  regenerated and visually inspected after source changes.
- Runtime config, WeChat keys/cache, chat-derived databases, logs, Obsidian
  output, OAuth material, mounted-target receipts and attachment bytes never
  belong in Git.
- Public publication must preserve public-safe defaults and exclude raw chat
  identities/bodies, account identifiers, local paths, credentials, private
  continuity and live runtime data.
- `scripts/build_share_package.py` packages the exact Git commit tree. Its
  generated guide comes from an exact-commit tracked template and is mode/hash
  bound under manifest `controls`; the no-Git path is manifest-only and
  hash-verifies regular non-symlink payload/control entries. Do not reintroduce
  recursive fallback scanning or live-runtime control text.

## Verification and deployment

Run from repository root:

The complete suite requires the optional `requirements-mcp.txt` dependencies
as well as `requirements.txt`. A base-only run may skip MCP protocol tests and
must not be reported as complete compatibility verification. CI exercises
ordinary app loading without the SDK before installing the optional dependency
and running the full regression suite.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -p 'test_*.py'
.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q app.py mcp_server.py setup.py ai core ui scripts tests
for launcher in 启动.command launchers/*.command; do bash -n "$launcher"; done
```

Use focused `tests.<module>` runs while iterating, then the full suite for
shared code, packaging, public-boundary or runtime changes. Source completion,
private/public publication, app-bundle rebuild, LaunchAgent reload and live
acceptance are separate gates. Do not mutate live config/data or reload a live
agent merely because source tests pass.

For the shared foundation on Windows, also run:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest `
  tests.windows `
  tests.test_repository_layout `
  tests.test_state_storage `
  tests.test_source_adapter.CapabilityTests `
  tests.test_source_adapter.CursorTokenTests `
  tests.test_source_adapter.ErrorVocabularyTests `
  tests.test_source_adapter.InventoryBindingTests `
  tests.test_source_adapter.SourcePageTests `
  tests.test_keychain tests.test_ai_factory tests.test_google_drive_auth.ProtectedRefreshTokenStoreTests `
  tests.test_config.ConfigTests.test_config_store_preserves_concurrent_disjoint_process_updates `
  tests.test_monitor_state.MonitorStateStoreTests.test_two_processes_cannot_replace_the_same_revision `
  tests.test_source_inventory.SourceInventoryStoreTests.test_concurrent_reconcile_preserves_inventory_union_and_revisions
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m compileall -q mcp_server.py ai core ui scripts tests
```

The portability workflow is the macOS regression authority; a Windows host
cannot waive or simulate that gate.

## Review ref resolution

Before producing a code-review finding, resolve and print `repository`,
`requested_ref`, `resolved_sha`, `default_branch_sha`, `merge_base`, and
`applies_to`. When Faye supplies a named active branch, PR branch, or review
URL, inspect that exact immutable SHA. Never transfer a finding from the
default branch to the active branch, and never fall back to `main` when the
requested ref cannot be resolved; fail closed instead. Every finding title
must include `applies_to=<ref>@<sha>`. If a default-branch defect is already
closed on a verified active branch, label both facts explicitly.

## Documentation triggers

Update README EN/ZH when entrypoints, supported behavior, privacy boundaries,
installation, repository layout or ordinary commands change. Update operator
guides for changed procedures and this file when source ownership, required
verification or deployment gates change.

Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the matching GitHub templates together when the
claim/review/evidence workflow changes. Keep Windows technical sequencing in
`docs/WINDOWS-DEVELOPMENT.md` and the module status in
`docs/WINDOWS-PORT-MAP.md`; do not duplicate those contracts into templates.

`docs/share-package-guide.zh-CN.md` is the sole tracked offline-guide template.
The share-package builder may emit it as `群友使用说明.md` inside an exact-commit
artifact; do not recreate root `使用说明.txt` or `功能说明.txt` as competing
documentation surfaces.

## Recovery hardening boundary

- Production monitor work freezes a content-free `pending_source_batch` in
  the existing MonitorStateStore before provider invocation. It binds the
  original checkpoint, policy, exact member IDs, content fingerprint and next
  cursors; it does not advance those cursors. Retries use its raw row count and
  validate the exact membership, content and inventory before any provider
  replay. The final progress CAS removes the descriptor. Never discard it on
  parse failure, configuration drift or source changes. Explicit reset-to-now
  retains its existing destructive meaning and clears pending intent too.
- A checkpoint with pending intent uses monitor-state v2, so old readers fail
  closed rather than ignore it. Acknowledgment returns the file to v1. Never
  downgrade the schema while pending work remains; v1/unversioned pending
  records are invalid. This is independent of knowledge-DB migration safety.
- MonitorStateStore's separate nonblocking execution lock serializes a full
  run without holding the checkpoint lock across provider work. State writers
  still use revision CAS; normal process exit/crash releases run ownership.
- Provider decisions need typed `match`/`score` and a non-empty retained body.
  MonitorDecisionError is content-free and retries with the existing bounded
  short-retry/backoff mechanism. Invalid output must never enter `no_match`.
  Health may validate/count pending metadata but must not print it or read
  WeChat. Existing legacy relation parsing is a different boundary.

- `core/key_extractor.py::recover_keys` returns a structured observed-key
  result. Only HMAC-verified candidates may be published; C staging JSON is
  never authority. Every publisher, including legacy rematch, uses the same
  existing portable lock backend around fresh-read/reverify/merge/replace.
  This adds a macOS runtime consumer, not Windows key/runtime support.
- Profile selection binds to the selected NSRunningApplication's launch,
  executable, bundle build and executing architecture. Diagnostic default-app
  lookup and Python architecture must never choose the scan mask.
- `core/wechat_resign.py` owns explicit exact-target re-sign orchestration;
  `scripts/resign_wechat.py` and `launchers/启动.command` are thin entrypoints.
  Bind canonical bundle, PID/launch/executable identity across privilege
  acquisition, graceful termination, signing, independent verification and
  exact-path reopen. Signing must use the persistent per-machine self-signed
  identity from `core/wechat_signing_identity.py`
  (`~/Library/Keychains/wgo-wechat-identity.keychain-db` plus its mode-0600
  password sidecar); never fall back to a bare ad-hoc `codesign --sign -`,
  because macOS TCC cannot retain consent granted to a bare cdhash. sudo is
  acquired only to chown the exact target bundle back to the operator when it
  is not writable; signing itself runs unprivileged against the managed
  keychain, and post-sign verification must require the designated
  requirement to anchor the managed certificate root and reject ad-hoc
  output. Never restore process-name kill, post-mutation default-app
  discovery or implicit re-sign permission.
- Scanner execution authority is an immutable private build directory plus a
  single atomic `scanner-current.json` pointer. The receipt binds source,
  compiler, target architecture, flags and binary identity. A legacy fixed
  binary, incomplete directory or metadata-only match is not admissible.
- `extract_keys()` returns keys only for a freshly verified complete observed
  set. Partial/unsupported/failed operations preserve the cache on disk and
  do not claim refresh success. Observed keys do not prove expected inventory
  completeness or successful monitor decoding.
- Zstd decoding failures raise `source_message_decode_failed`; they must not
  become empty filtered rows, advance monitor/resource cursors, or trigger AI.
- First source enablement stays from-now. Once per-shard cursors exist, a
  replacement generation or new logical shard must fail before page/provider
  work with an exact content-free admission plan; never borrow the global
  timestamp. Durable message identity is logical and generation-stable, while
  the physical generation remains separate cursor evidence. The v1 plan does
  not itself authorize replay or cursor translation.
- Canonical events and `daily_digest_changes` commit in one knowledge-DB
  transaction. Digest repair consumes canonical SQLite, atomically republishes
  existing affected pages, and ACKs only the completed prefix. Before provider
  replay, monitor retry must adopt an already committed `source_batch_id` and
  advance that exact batch; lookup failure preserves the checkpoint.
- Catch-up prints the actual `rebuild_projections` notes/actions contract;
  tests must connect the real producer to apply/output/receipt.
- `core/wechat_signature.py` owns the read-only strict/identity/no-runtime
  predicate: strict verification must pass, the CS_RUNTIME bit must be
  absent, and the signature must be either legacy ad-hoc or anchored to the
  managed stable signing identity; explicit re-sign verification passes the
  expected certificate root so ad-hoc output is rejected there. Startup,
  Python runtime, and explicit re-sign verification share
  it. `get_wechat_app_path()` honors the session-bound target first; an invalid
  explicit binding never selects a different installation.
- `core/monitor_result.py` owns catch-up outcome interpretation. Only the
  existing post-commit progress codes may consume page budget; new/unknown
  codes block. EOF must be the literal verified boolean. Health reports the
  newest bounded code without falling back to old success. Preflight retains
  source error reasons in the same reconciliation receipt schema.
- A failed provisional receipt is sticky for the entire catch-up run, even
  after a final receipt succeeds. Restore is still attempted; no retry may
  erase missing recovery evidence or report the run complete.
- Health must not call the protected-source key scanner. Keep native checks
  and limits in `docs/reliability-closure.md`; source-window unit evidence is
  not complete-repository or live macOS acceptance.
- Source acceptance and remaining migration/live gates are described in
  `docs/recovery-acceptance.md`. Native Cocoa/C/macOS canary, installation,
  activation and deployment consent remain separate from source tests.
