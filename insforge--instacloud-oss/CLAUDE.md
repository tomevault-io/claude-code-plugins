# Contributing a template

For humans and agents alike. One template per folder under `templates/<code>/`, and the folder name
IS the template code. Copying the closest existing template is the fastest way to start.

## Files

- `insta.template.yaml`: the manifest, and the source of truth. Required.
- `Dockerfile`: only when the template builds an overlay image. The workspace templates
  (`claude-code`, `codex`, `pi`) do; a template that references an official upstream image, like
  `n8n`, must not rebuild it. It is wired **by convention**: `templates-build-images.yml` builds
  `templates/<code>/` and pushes `ghcr.io/insforge/insta-oss/templates/<code>:<version>`, which the
  manifest then references as `image:`. Never add a `build:` key to the manifest. The catalog
  rejects a service carrying both `image:` and `build:`, and `image:` is the one that deploys.
- **Companion images.** A template directory builds exactly one image, so a template that needs a
  second one (a service built from source alongside the first, such as the browser worker `openmuse`
  runs next to its API, the way upstream's blueprint splits them) puts that image in its own sibling
  directory and references it. A service's `image:` may name a sibling template's published image,
  `ghcr.io/insforge/insta-oss/templates/<sibling>:<sibling-version>`, as long as that sibling exists
  here and the tag is its version; lint checks both. The sibling is usually `meta.draft: true`, so it
  never shows in the gallery on its own. A version bump moves a template's own image and leaves a
  companion alone: the companion moves when its own directory bumps.
- `README.md`: the detail page shown in the gallery. Required, and factual: leave a fact out rather
  than guess it. Follow the section order the existing templates use, which is Overview, what you
  get by hosting it, what you need before deploying, Configuration (a row per variable saying what
  it does and where the value comes from), After deploy (how to actually start using it), and
  Links (upstream, the image or package, the license). A draft template opens with a note saying
  why it is draft.
- The **deploy button**, in its own paragraph under the title and tagline, for every publishable
  template: `[![Deploy on InstaCloud](<cdn>/assets/deploy-button.svg)](https://instacloud.com/templates/<code>)`.
  CI rejects a publishable template that omits it, checks that the href names this template's own
  code, and rejects one on a draft, whose gallery page does not exist until it publishes. Since
  copying the nearest template is the fastest way to start, a code carried over from the one you
  copied is the mistake that check exists for. The publish step removes the line on the way to
  the catalog, so the gallery does not show a second copy of the call to action its own rail
  already carries. The asset and the snippet live in [assets/README.md](../assets/README.md).
- `logo.svg`: the template's mark, and a **hard requirement for a publishable template**. CI
  rejects a non-draft template without one. Declare the path as `meta.logo: ./logo.svg` and CI
  checks that it resolves. Details and the reasoning are under [Logos](#logos).
- Screenshots and any other README assets: keep them in your own template directory and reference
  them with **relative** paths, such as `![](./screenshot.png)`. The README is published to the
  gallery as text, where a relative path would resolve against the gallery's own origin and 404, so
  the publish step rewrites relative targets into absolute URLs pinned to the publishing commit:
  images through the same CDN as the logo, and links to the GitHub page a reader can browse. Two
  rules follow, both enforced by CI: a referenced asset must exist, and an image may not point
  outside its own template directory, because nothing outside it is the template's to ship.

## Hard rules (CI rejects violations)

1. Image references pin a specific tag or digest. `latest` or tagless is rejected, because an
   image that floats on `latest` silently changes under a deployed instance on every restart.
2. Every required variable without a generator has a `description` saying what it is and where to
   get it.
3. `code`, `version` (semver), `maintainer`, `upstream.pinned` and `meta.category` are mandatory.
4. A changed template must bump its `version`. The canonical image tag is derived from it, so
   editing a template without bumping would overwrite an image that published instances pull.
5. A template with a `Dockerfile` names its pin there too: `upstream.pinned` or `upstream.commit`
   has to appear in it, and where the `FROM` builds on `upstream.image`, that instruction's tag has
   to be the pinned one and its digest, if the manifest carries one, has to match. The version is
   written twice and nothing else notices when the two disagree: the image would be built from one
   version while the catalog advertises another, and the build would succeed.
6. A service may not carry both `image:` and `build:`.
7. `constraints[].oneOf` and `allOf` may only name variables the manifest declares.
8. A manifest never sizes a service. There is no `spec:`, and `volume:` is the boolean `true`, not
   a size. CPU, memory and disk are the platform's to choose and are capped for the org's plan, so
   a number here could only drift from it: every template once carried `size: 1` because that was
   the free cap the day it was written. `npm run lint` refuses both, and so does publish.
9. Never commit `index.json`. CI generates it.
10. `meta.architectures` is mandatory, drafts included: a non-empty list of `amd64`, `arm64`, or
   both. See [Architectures](#architectures).
11. A `${...}` inside an `env.fixed` value may only be `${services.<name>.url}` or
   `${services.<name>.host}`, naming a service the manifest declares that is not a managed
   database, not a bucket and not a worker. A managed database or a bucket has no address: its
   credentials belong under `env.platform` as `${{services.<name>.<KEY>}}`, with doubled braces,
   and putting that form in `fixed` is rejected. A worker has no address either, see rule 12. So is
   a generator ref, even a
   declared one: composed into a fixed string it is stored only as the final value, so a retry
   could not recover it and would silently rotate the secret. Declare the variable under
   `env.generated` instead. `npm run lint` mirrors the platform's check.
12. A `type: worker` service is portless. The platform runs it with no routed port: nothing is
   routed to it, nothing probes it, and it stays always-on because no request could wake it. So
   it carries no `port`, no `healthcheck` and no `alwaysOn: false`, and no other service may
   reference its `url` or `host`. Its health is the machine's state (started and not crashed). Use
   it for queue consumers, schedulers and bots that only make outbound connections, and give it a
   `volume: true` if it keeps state, since a restart clears the root filesystem. `npm run lint`
   refuses the four shapes, and so does publish.
13. A service is `web`, `worker`, a bucket (`storage`), or one of the managed datastores `postgres`,
   `redis`, `mysql` and `mongodb`. A managed datastore is declared **bare**, as `{ type: redis }`
   and nothing else: the platform owns its image, port, sizing and credentials, and a manifest that
   named any of them could only drift from the platform's catalog. Two optional fields are the
   exception, each on one type only: `pgVersion` on `postgres`, an integer Postgres major (absent
   means the platform's default), and `public` on `storage`, a boolean for anonymous public-read
   (absent means private). A bucket is bare too, with no env, no volume and no region. Consume a
   datastore or a bucket through `env.platform` with `${{services.<name>.<KEY>}}`, never through
   `${services.<name>.url}`, which is refused. Each managed datastore is born with its own data
   volume at the deployer's plan cap, so a template that declares two of them costs two volumes.
   `npm run lint` warns above two and does not count a bucket, which has no volume.
   Declaring `redis`, `mysql`, `mongodb` or `storage` makes a template cloud-only today, and so does
   a `pgVersion` that is not the major the self-hosted runtime runs. This repository's own runtime
   (`src/`) parses `web`, `worker`, `postgres` and `storage`. It skips a template that declares
   `redis`, `mysql` or `mongodb`, logging a warning, and it refuses to deploy a template with a
   bucket or with another Postgres major, answering 400. `npm run lint` warns on all of these and
   never fails the run over them.
14. `command` overrides the image's start command and runs through `sh -c`, on a web or worker service.
   It must be a non-empty string. `npm run lint` refuses an empty one, and so does publish. It is
   cloud-only today: the self-hosted runtime refuses to run it, and lint prints a warning.
15. `mountPath` moves the volume off `/data`. It needs `volume: true` and an absolute path.
   `npm run lint` refuses a missing `volume: true` and a relative path. Publish also refuses system
   directories, `..`, and characters other than letters, digits, `.`, `-`, `_` and `/`. It is
   cloud-only today, like `command`.
16. A service carries only keys the platform knows, the ones in `SERVICE_KEYS` in
   `scripts/lint.mjs`, which mirrors the platform's `TEMPLATE_FIELDS`. A misspelt key is refused by
   name, where it used to be ignored on both sides. The top level, `meta` and `upstream` stay open.
   `npm run lint` and publish refuse it, and so does the self-hosted runtime for an inline manifest.

## Architectures

`meta.architectures` names the CPU architectures your template's deployable image is published
for, in OCI naming: `[amd64, arm64]`, or one of the two. It is not decoration. Three things read
it, so a wrong answer is worse than no template at all:

- `templates-build-images.yml` derives its buildx `platforms` from it and, after pushing, checks
  the pushed index against it. Declaring `arm64` for an image that cannot cross-build turns the
  build red.
- The catalog serves it, and the dashboard greys out a template this box cannot run.
- `insta template deploy` refuses the pair before it creates a single service. Without the field
  the deploy runs, creates the services and the variables, and only then fails on the pull with
  docker's `no matching manifest for linux/arm64/v8`, leaving half a template behind.

**Prove it before you declare it.** From the repository root:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 templates/<code>          # it builds
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 --load -t probe templates/<code>
docker run --rm probe <your app's version command>                   # and it runs
```

Two traps, both real, both found in this registry:

- **Pin the index digest, not a child's.** `FROM upstream:1.2@sha256:...` is only multi-arch if
  that digest is the OCI index. Take it from the top-level `Digest:` line of
  `docker buildx imagetools inspect upstream:1.2`, never from one of the `Manifests:` rows. A
  child digest resolves to that one platform whatever `--platform` says, which is exactly how
  `9router` shipped an amd64-only image while every other pin was fine.
- **A per-architecture download needs a per-architecture checksum.** The ttyd templates switch on
  `dpkg --print-architecture` and verify a different SHA-256 for each. A single pinned checksum
  cannot be right for both.

If an upstream genuinely publishes only one architecture, declare only that one. That is an
honest template: the catalog says so, the workflow builds only what exists, and a user on the
other architecture is told before they deploy rather than after. Do not declare both and hope.

## Logos

A template directory owns everything about itself, so contributing one is a single pull request
here rather than a manifest PR plus an asset PR somewhere else. Prefer SVG. `logo.png` is fine when
upstream has no vector mark: keep it square, roughly 128 to 512 px, and under about 100 KB.

- Use the upstream project's **own** mark, never a redrawn one.
- Check the project's **product site**, not just its repository. A repo often carries only a banner
  or a README screenshot while the site serves a real mark. `pi.dev/logo-auto.svg` is where pi's
  came from, after its repository appeared to have none.
- **A mark must not theme itself.** No `@media (prefers-color-scheme)` rule. Every surface that
  shows a logo (the console, this repo's UI, the marketing gallery) draws it inside its own neutral
  tile, and the gallery pins that tile to the light scheme. Firefox ignores the pin inside an
  `<img>`, so a mark that repaints itself white for dark mode disappears on the light tile. pi's
  mark predates this rule and still themes itself.
- Reject a `<text>`-based mark even when it is upstream's own favicon. A glyph in `system-ui`
  renders differently on every machine, and two of the upstreams here ship exactly that.
- Use upstream's **current** brand colours. Prefer a transparent file, and check transparency from
  the corner pixels' alpha rather than the colour type, because an RGBA file can still be fully
  opaque. When upstream ships its current mark only on its own plate, as an app icon or favicon,
  use that file unchanged rather than a monochrome or retired transparent one: the surface's tile
  frames it, so the plate reads as an app icon. `hermes` and `clickhouse` both do this.
- Whichever file you take, record the choice in the attribution table in [README.md](README.md),
  including why when it carries a plate. Do not hand-cut one.
- If upstream has no mark at all, declare `meta.logo: none`. Consumers fall back to a monogram.
  That declaration gets reviewed; a missing file does not.

Why the file lives in the repo instead of a URL in the manifest: a gallery that lets an author name
any URL ends up pulling images from image hosts and personal CDNs, which rot silently, arrive in
unpredictable sizes, and send every visitor's browser to a third party. Keeping the file here means
the catalog holds only a reference, and it is served from a CDN pinned to the publishing commit.

## Conventions

- Volumes mount at `/data` unless the service declares `mountPath` (rule 15). Prefer `/data` and point
  the app's data directory there with its own env var (`HERMES_HOME`, `N8N_USER_FOLDER`, `HOME`).
- Fair-code upstreams such as n8n: reference the official image, and never rebuild or rebrand it.
- A template that exposes a terminal MUST require an access credential (for ttyd, the `-c` flag).
- Categories are `ai-agent`, `llm`, `automation`, `backend` (database, auth, storage and functions
  shipped as one backend, such as Supabase), `database` (a single datastore, such as ClickHouse) and
  `crm` (customer relationship management, such as Twenty). Propose a new one in your PR rather than
  reaching for `other`. A new category also needs a label in the console (`TEMPLATE_CATEGORIES`) and
  the marketing gallery (`CATEGORIES`), or it is listed only under All, and it belongs in both
  `TEMPLATE_CATEGORY_ORDER` and `LABELS` in
  [ui/src/lib/templatePicker.ts](../ui/src/lib/templatePicker.ts), which mirrors the console's list
  and labels for this repo's own UI. That third place is easy to miss: a category absent from it
  still gets a rail entry and a guessed label, it just sorts in alphabetically after the ones the
  console orders deliberately, which is a difference nothing fails on.
- `meta.draft: true` keeps a template out of the gallery while it is unfinished. Drafts are exempt
  from the logo and version-bump rules, because they publish nothing.
- Everything in this tree is **English**, comments included. A comment only some contributors can
  read is a comment that rots.
- User-facing strings are `meta.name`, `meta.tagline`, every variable `description`, and the README.
  They render in the public gallery and in the deploy form. Keep a tagline short: a noun phrase
  saying what the thing is, roughly 6 to 10 words, no trailing period, and never restating the
  template name that the card already shows.
- `upstream.license` carries the SPDX identifier of the software being packaged. Use the
  `LicenseRef-` form when it is not an OSS license, such as a vendor's commercial terms, and read
  the value off the upstream repository or package rather than assuming it.
- No em dashes in this repo, matching the rest of the docs.

## Flow

Open a pull request against `main`. CI runs the lint and the version guard; a reviewer merges; the
publish workflow syncs the change to the hosted catalog. Deployed instances never auto-update, so
bumping `version` is what surfaces an "update available" marker to someone already running it.
