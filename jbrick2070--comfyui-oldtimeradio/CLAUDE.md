# otr-cli-hold

> When a CLI task in this repo says not to commit or not to update GO_FORWARD, obey that and leave both alone

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/otr-cli-hold/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# CLI hold — this repo only

This applies while working in `ComfyUI-OldTimeRadio`. It does not travel to other projects.

The standing law is still: a finished green chunk is committed and pushed to `main`, named files only. `apple/GO_FORWARD_PLAN.md` is still where shared multi-step work is written down.

When the current CLI task, prompt, or plan says not to commit, or not to update `apple/GO_FORWARD_PLAN.md`:

- Do not commit.
- Do not push.
- Do not edit `apple/GO_FORWARD_PLAN.md`.
- Do not stage unrelated files that are already dirty in the tree.

That hold lasts for that task only. A later task that does not say it returns to the standing commit-and-push law.
