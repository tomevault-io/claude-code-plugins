> OTR operator law — CLAUDE.md wins; root-cause fixes; no episode guardrails; story quality is closed

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/otr-operating/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# OTR operating law

`CLAUDE.md` at the repo root is the source of truth. Operator directives there win over any handoff, memory, or this rule. Do not duplicate or weaken it.

- Fix at the root cause. No shims. Do not wait for the operator to run commands.
- Never ask to commit. Always commit and push a green chunk to `main` in the same turn (operator 2026-09-17). Named files only.
- Generated episode content is unfiltered (no profanity/violence prompt bans). Authoring stays clean: no curse words in code, comments, logs, or commits; never the name `dummy`.
- Story quality is closed. Do not chase prose, writer models, or word-count gates. Gender/voice/face/ledger faults remain bugs.
- Never invent a Jeffrey-only path. Portable means that install's `output/otr/obs` via Comfy's live output directory (`folder_paths` / `--output-directory`).
- Knowledge gate before diagnosis or implementation: relevant `apple/PROD_BUG_LOG.md`, Bug Bible in `comfyui-custom-node-survival-guide`.
- A helper is wired in the same change that builds it, or the row says why not. Grep `nodes/` for a non-test caller.
