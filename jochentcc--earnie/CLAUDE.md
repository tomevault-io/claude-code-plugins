# english-chat

> Keep chat and assistant replies in English unless the user asks otherwise

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/english-chat/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Chat Language — English

Reply in **English** in chat, summaries, commit messages (unless the user asks for another language), and explanations — even when:

- The user writes in German
- Project docs, UI labels, error messages, or backlog text are in German
- You are editing German `.md` files (see `german-markdown.mdc` for doc handling only)

## Do

- Use English for all assistant-facing prose
- Quote German source text verbatim when citing configs, errors, UI strings, or file content
- Keep exact backlog/version identifiers as in the repo (e.g. `1.26.0 P2`, `UI S-2 P3a`)

## Do not

- Switch the reply language to German because the project or the latest user message is German
- Translate quoted errors or config keys into English unless explaining them

## Exception

If the user explicitly asks for German (or another language) in a message, use that language for that reply or scope they specify.
