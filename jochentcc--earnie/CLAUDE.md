> Ask once before relying on German project markdown — offer translation

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/german-markdown/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# German Markdown in This Project

Some project `.md` files may still be in German (e.g. `docs/spec/`, older notes). **Backlog files are in English** (`backlog/Backlog.md`, `backlog/Backlog-Bugfixes.md`, `backlog/Backlog-Erledigt.md`).

**User docs** (`docs/README.md`, `docs/user-manual/`, `docs/einrichtung/`, `docs/konfiguration/`, `docs/ui/`, `docs/referenz/`) are **intentionally German** — see `german-user-docs.mdc`. Do not offer to translate them to English; read as-is.

## When This Applies

Before you **read and use** a project `.md` file for decisions, implementation, or summaries — and the file is **predominantly German** and **not** in the user-doc scope above — **ask the user once**:

> This file is still in German: `<path>`. Should I translate it to English first, or read it as-is?

## Rules

- **Ask once per file per session.** After the user answers for that file, follow their choice; do not ask again for the same file in the same chat.
- **Do not translate silently.** Only translate when the user explicitly agrees.
- **If the user declines or does not answer:** read the German content as-is; do not block the task.
- **If the user agrees:** translate the file (preserve structure, paths, code identifiers, version numbers), then continue with the task.
- **Scope:** project `.md` files only — not user messages, external links, or non-markdown sources.
- **Exempt:** files already in English; brief German fragments inside otherwise English docs (UI labels, proper nouns) do not trigger a translation offer by themselves.

## Examples

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Task requires `docs/konfiguration/preise.md` (German) | Ask once: translate or read as-is? |
| User already said “read as-is” for that file this session | Read without asking again |
| `backlog/Backlog.md` (English) | No ask |
| German word in a code comment or config label | No ask |
