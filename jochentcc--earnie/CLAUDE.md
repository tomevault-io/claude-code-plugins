# cursorignore-access

> If you need access to something that's blocked by `.cursorignore` (unreadable file/folder, missing index), then **don't just ignore it or guess**.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/cursorignore-access/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# .cursorignore — Actively coordinate access

If you need access to something that's blocked by `.cursorignore` (unreadable file/folder, missing index), then **don't just ignore it or guess**.

Instead: actively ask the user and decide together what to do with the `.cursorignore` entry.

## Procedure

1. Briefly state **which** file/folder you want to see and **why** (purpose).

2. State **which** entry in `.cursorignore` is blocking access.

3. Offer options for a decision, e.g.:

- Modify/remove the entry (make it permanently readable)

- Add a specific exception (`!path/...`) instead of deleting the entry

- Copy/extract the file once to a non-ignored location

- Leave it as is (no access) and proceed differently

4. Only act after confirmation. Never change `.cursorignore` on your own.

## Background

`.cursorignore` is intentionally restrictive (access credentials, production configuration, runtime/dumps).

Some entries may be too broad—therefore, if in doubt, decide together,
instead of forcing access or foregoing the information altogether.
