# Versioning (version.py)

Format: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (Semantic Versioning in `version.py`).

Optional **pre-release** suffix for community test builds only: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-alpha.N`, `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-beta.N`, or `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-rc.N` (e.g. `2.2.0-alpha.1`, `2.6.1-beta.1`). No backlog letter suffixes (`.a`, `.b`) in `version.py`.

## Principle: user approval (required)

- **Never change `version.py` without explicit user confirmation** — not at session end, not for bugfixes, not when a backlog chapter is completed, not for alpha/beta/rc bumps.
- Instead: **propose** (target version + brief rationale) and **ask**.
- On rejection or no response: leave `version.py` **unchanged**.
- Commit messages may reference backlog chapters (`hausconfig: 1.24.f …`) — that does **not** replace an automatic version bump.

## Distinction `version.py` ↔ backlog

| Level | File / location | Notation | Purpose |
|-------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| **Release state** | `version.py` | `1.24.0` | Published app/container version (only after user approval) |
| **Pre-release** | `version.py` | `2.2.0-alpha.1` / `2.6.1-beta.1` | Community test build on `main` (GitHub Pre-release; no `:latest`) |
| **Development step** | `backlog/Backlog.md` | `1.24.f` | Sub-step in the MINOR cycle (planning/progress) |

- Letter chapters (`.a`, `.b`, … `.g`) and the release chapter (`.0`) exist **only in the backlog**, not in `version.py`.
- Backlog progress (moving chapters to `backlog/Backlog-Erledigt.md`) is **independent** of `version.py`.

## Pre-releases (alpha / beta / rc)

- Publish from **`main`**: approve bump → commit → push → annotated tag `vX.Y.Z-alpha.N` / `-beta.N` / `-rc.N` (must match `version.py`).
- CI (`.github/workflows/release-publish.yml`): the tag builds a **candidate** (GHCR `:<version>`, draft release). After the user tests it and approves job `promote` (environment `release-approval`): GitHub Release with `--prerelease` (not `--latest`), GHCR `:next` (no `:latest`), HA add-on `earnie_prerelease` pin. Details: skill `session-abschluss` Phase 2.
- A rejected candidate is never re-tagged — fix, approved bump to the next pre-release (`alpha.N+1` / `beta.N+1` / …), tag again.
- Leave the pre-release string on `main` until the next approved bump (`alpha.N+1`, `beta.N`, `rc.N`, or final `X.Y.Z`). Do **not** bump back to the previous official version after tagging.
- Backlog letters stay planning-only; do not invent backlog IDs like `2.2.0-alpha.1`.

## MINOR cycle: no automatic increment

While working on the **same MINOR cycle** — i.e. backlog chapters `MAJOR.MINOR.letter` still exist (e.g. `1.24.a` … `1.24.g`) and/or the corresponding release chapter `MAJOR.MINOR.0` has not yet been approved for release by the user:

- **Do not automatically bump `version.py`** — neither MINOR nor PATCH.
- Completing individual letter chapters does **not** justify a PATCH (+1).
- Example: while `1.24.c` … `1.24.g` and `1.24.0` are in the backlog → `version.py` stays e.g. `1.24.0`, **not** `1.24.1` … `1.24.3`.
- Mid-cycle community builds use pre-releases of the **target** release (e.g. `2.2.0-alpha.1` while backlog still has `2.2.a` …), not PATCH bumps of the previous official version.

**After the entire MINOR cycle is complete** (all chapters of that MINOR number done): **suggest** a version bump only and ask the user (typical: next chapter is `1.25.0` → `1.25.0`; or PATCH on last state — user decides).

## When to suggest a bump (always only after approval)

| Occasion | Typical suggestion | Decision |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Entire MINOR cycle complete, release desired | `MAJOR.MINOR.0` or next MINOR | User |
| Next MINOR chapter complete (e.g. `1.25.0`) | `1.25.0` | User |
| Community test build desired | `X.Y.Z-alpha.N`, `X.Y.Z-beta.N`, or `X.Y.Z-rc.N` | User |
| Bugfix complete | PATCH +1 | User |
| `### Version N.+1` complete | MINOR +1, PATCH = 0 | User |
| Cycle start: set target MINOR once | e.g. `1.24.0` | User |

No fixed automation like "`.a` → MINOR", "`.b` → PATCH" — that mapping does **not** apply.

## Session conclusion

- Maintain backlog as usual (`backlog.mdc`).
- **No** silent version bump at session end.
- If a release or community pre-release seems appropriate: ask once (official vs alpha/beta/rc); otherwise skip.

Commit message may include the version if the user set it: `… (v1.24.0)` or `… (v2.2.0-alpha.1)` / `… (v2.6.1-beta.1)`.
