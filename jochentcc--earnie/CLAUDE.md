# session-abschluss

> End session — backlog sync, commit all changes, push, optional Docker

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/session-abschluss/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Session Conclusion

When the user wants to **end session**, **backlog sync**, **commit and push**, or a comparable session wrap-up:

1. Follow skill `.cursor/skills/session-abschluss/SKILL.md` in full
2. **Phase 1:** Maintain `backlog/Backlog.md` / `backlog/Backlog-Bugfixes.md` / `backlog/Backlog-Erledigt.md` → commit all approved open changes → push
3. **`version.py`:** change only after explicit user approval (see `versioning.mdc`) — no automatic bump at session end
4. On approved **D** bump to a pre-release (or before **B**): sync `docker/compose/*-alpha.yml` `image:` tags to `version.py` (skill section **Alpha compose sync**)
5. For local or possibly temporary files **ask first** (e.g. personal VS Code settings, local paths)
6. **Always ask** whether private earnie-env / `Earnie-env-home` changes should be committed, pushed, and tagged (skill §2a)
7. After Phase 1: present the skill’s **Publish decision guide** (**A** skip / **B** pre-release / **C** official / **D** bump then publish) with live `version.py` and one recommended choice
8. **Phase 2** (tag / Docker) **only** after the user picks B, C, or D→B/C — never automatically
9. A tag builds a **candidate** only; the user tests it on the target platform and approves job `promote` (environment `release-approval`) themselves — never approve/reject on their behalf; `streamlitcloud` reset only after approval

Commit and push approval is implied by the end-session request; still do not commit secrets or gitignored files.
