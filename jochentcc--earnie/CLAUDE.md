# branching-hotfix-playbook

> Warn before branching/publish steps that violate the hotfix playbook (main+tags, no long-lived alpha/develop)

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/branching-hotfix-playbook/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Branching / Hotfix Playbook Guard

Canonical playbook: `docs/spec/branching-hotfix-playbook.md`.

## When this applies

Before acting on (or recommending) any of: new long-lived branches, hotfixes for a tagged build, tagging/publishing while feature work is open, PATCH vs alpha bumps for bugfixes, or “fix prod only on main and ship later.”

## Warn the user (stop and ask) if they are about to

| Violation | Prefer instead |
|-----------|----------------|
| Create permanent `develop`, `alpha`, or long-lived `release/*` | Stay on `main`; pre-release = version/tag channel only |
| Urgent patch for a **tagged** build by shipping dirty unfinished `main` | Short-lived `hotfix/…` from that **tag**, then port fix to `main` |
| Hotfix only on the release tip **without** merging/cherry-picking to `main` | Always port the code fix to `main` |
| Tag a commit where `version.py` ≠ tag (without `v`) | Bump/align `version.py` first (explicit approval) |
| Mid-alpha cycle: PATCH the **last official** for a community tester fix | Next `X.Y.Z-alpha.N+1` / `-beta.N+1` (after approval), unless patching prod `:latest` |
| Rewind `main`’s `version.py` to an official PATCH while alpha continues | Port **code** only; leave `main` on the ongoing alpha/beta/rc |
| Rewrite / force-push a published tag | New tag with a new approved version string |

## Default (no warning needed)

- Bugfix on `main` → next session publish **D** (if needed) → **B** or **C**
- Short-lived `hotfix/…` from tag only when users need a build **now** and `main` must not ship yet

## How to remind

One short warning + point to the playbook path + ask which path they want (default on `main` vs hotfix-from-tag). Do not silently create forbidden branches or skip porting to `main`.
