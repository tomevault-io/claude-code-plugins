# Backtesting / SE — maximum useful workers

When starting `scripts/run_backtesting.py` (including SE calc matrix / one-off year runs):

- **Always pass `--workers N`** with the largest *useful* N — never default to `1` unless the user asks for sequential debug.
- Parallelism is **across top-level jobs** (historical/reference tasks + each scenario), **not** across windows inside one scenario.
- Compute:

```text
N = min(CPU logical count, number of parallel jobs)
parallel jobs ≈ len(reference_specs) + len(scenarios)
```

Typical Live-only year: ~3 jobs → `--workers 3` (or `min(cpu, 3)`).  
Multi-scenario: match job count (e.g. 4 scenarios + refs → often 5–6), capped by CPU.

- On Windows, ensure worker children see the intended env (`EARNIE_ENV_PATH`, and do **not** leave stale `EARNIE_HOUSE_PROFILES_PATH` / `EARNIE_BACKTESTING_SCENARIOS_PATH` pointing at `se_calc_test/cells/…` overlays).
- Prefer `os.cpu_count()` (logical) for the CPU cap.
- **Windows spawn:** run via a real module (`python -m scripts.…`), not `python -c "…"`, so `ProcessPoolExecutor` workers start reliably.
