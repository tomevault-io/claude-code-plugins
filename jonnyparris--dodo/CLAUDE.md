# AGENTS.md

Autonomous coding agent on Cloudflare Workers. Self-hostable, multi-tenant, sandboxed.

## Focus

- Multi-tenant: per-user state in UserControl DO, global state in SharedIndex DO.
- CodingAgent built on `@cloudflare/think` (chat loop, message persistence, durable fibers).
- Keep publishable and self-hostable. No container- or VM-specific assumptions.
- Correctness and test coverage over feature expansion.

## Commands

- `npm install`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run lint` (CI uses Biome; same signal locally)
- `npm test`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run deploy:safe` — build + deploy + post-deploy smoke probe. Use plain `npm run deploy` only when you mean to skip the probe.

## Rules

- Run `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` regularly while changing behavior.
- All Think imports route through `src/think-adapter.ts` — never import `@cloudflare/think` directly elsewhere.
- Prefer small, typed modules over large all-in-one files.
- Keep Durable Object state persistent and observable.
- Preserve Cloudflare Access in production; local test bypass is only for test/dev config.

## Where to Look

| Task | Location |
|------|----------|
| Source file map | `docs/file-map.md` |
| System prompt design + tool surface | `docs/system-prompt.md` |
| Skills loader + MCP CRUD | `docs/skills.md` |
| Linting (two-layer, why) | `docs/linting.md` |
| Deploy details + post-deploy probe | `docs/deploying.md` |
| Facets / scheduled sessions / notifications | `docs/facets.md`, `docs/scheduled-sessions.md`, `docs/notifications.md` |
| Goal-driven sessions (self-continuation) | `docs/session-goals.md` |
| Testing patterns | `docs/testing.md` |
| Watchdog | `docs/session-watchdog.md` |

## Git Discipline

**Never commit directly to `main`.** All changes go through feature branches. Two workflows — pick by runtime.

### Inside a Dodo session (sandboxed clone in a DO)

The session's clone *is* the workspace. **No worktrees** — they have no meaning here.

Git is split:
- **Top-level tools:** `git_status`, `git_add`, `git_commit`, `git_diff`.
- **Inside codemode (`git.<name>`):** `git_clone_known`, `git_clone`, `git_push`, `git_push_checked`, `git_pull`, `git_branch`, `git_checkout`, `git_log`, `git_verify_remote_branch`, `pr_create`.

Workflow:

1. After cloning, branch off `main` inside codemode: `await git.git_branch({ name: "feat/x" })` → `await git.git_checkout({ branch: "feat/x" })`.
2. Edit. Use top-level `git_status` / `git_add` / `git_commit`.
3. Push with `git.git_push_checked` (explicit branch ref, never `main`).
4. **Open the draft PR with `git.pr_create` before replying to the user.** Auto-detects GitHub vs GitLab, fills title/body from the latest commit, returns the URL. Quote that URL. If `pr_create` fails (e.g. missing per-user token), fall back to a compare URL and say what's missing — don't leave the user with a pushed branch and no PR.
5. Branch naming: `fix/sse-serialization`, `feat/per-user-auth`, `docs/update-readme`, `chore/<scope>`.

### Local via OpenCode CLI in `~/dev/dodo`

Concurrent agents share `~/dev/dodo`. Use worktrees:

1. `git worktree add ../dodo-<slug> -b <branch>`
2. Work in the worktree, not the main checkout.
3. Commit, push, open PR. Don't merge your own PRs.
4. Clean up: `git worktree remove ../dodo-<slug> && git branch -d <branch>`.

Without worktrees, concurrent agents create divergent histories on `main` and ugly merge commits. Worktrees in the Dodo-session case waste turns solving a problem that doesn't exist.

## File Map (top level)

See `docs/file-map.md` for the full list. Entry points:

- `src/index.ts` — Worker router, HTTP routes, auth, session fork
- `src/coding-agent.ts` — per-session DO. **Contains the system prompt.**
- `src/think-adapter.ts` — Think integration boundary
- `src/agentic.ts` — provider + tool composition
- `src/user-control.ts` — per-user DO
- `src/shared-index.ts` — global singleton DO
- `src/mcp.ts` — MCP server exposing Dodo capabilities
- `src/executor.ts` — DynamicWorkerExecutor for sandboxed code

## Architecture

```
Worker (Hono router + CF Access auth)
+-- SharedIndex DO (global singleton)
|   +-- users, host_allowlist, models_cache, session_shares, session_permissions
+-- UserControl DO (one per user, idFromName(email))
|   +-- user_config, sessions, memory_entries, tasks, key_envelope, encrypted_secrets, fork_snapshots
+-- CodingAgent DO (one per session, extends Think<Env, DodoConfig>)
|   +-- Think tables: assistant_sessions, assistant_messages, _think_config, cf_agents_fibers
|   +-- Dodo tables: metadata, message_metadata, prompts, cron_jobs
|   +-- Goal state: goal_text / goal_status / goal_turns_used in metadata (see docs/session-goals.md)
|   +-- Workspace (@cloudflare/shell, SQLite + optional R2 spill)
|   +-- createExecuteTool (codemode with workspace + git providers, gated outbound)
|   +-- One Think session per DO — single-session invariant
|   +-- Durable fibers — async prompts survive DO eviction
+-- AllowlistOutbound (WorkerEntrypoint, self-referencing service binding)
```

## Key Invariants

1. One Think session per Dodo DO — never more.
2. All Think imports through `src/think-adapter.ts`.
3. No `cf_agent_chat_*` WebSocket messages trigger Think chat.
4. Fiber methods use `stashFiber()` checkpoints — never assume resume-mid-execution.
5. Snapshot import handles both v1 and v2.
6. Git auth flows through Dodo's `resolveRemoteToken()`.
7. SSE/WS event protocol unchanged from the client's perspective.

## Investigating production with Polylane

[Polylane](https://polylane.com/?ref=github.onboarding-pr) is an AI production engineer: it watches deploys, telemetry, incidents, and the infrastructure this repository ships to, investigates problems as they happen, and proposes fixes as pull requests. It is connected to this repository and available to coding agents through the [Polylane MCP server](https://mcp.polylane.com/mcp).

- When a question involves production behaviour (an error, a spike, a deploy, a missing signal), query Polylane through its MCP tools before reasoning from the code alone.
- When debugging a failure, start from the incident or issue Polylane recorded: it carries the evidence an investigation already gathered.
- Polylane reviews pull requests in this repository against the live infrastructure. Read its review comment before merging changes that touch production paths.
