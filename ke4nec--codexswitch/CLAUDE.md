## Frontend tasks

When doing frontend design tasks, avoid generic, overbuilt layouts.

**Use these hard rules:**
- One composition: The first viewport must read as one composition, not a dashboard (unless it's a dashboard).
- Brand first: On branded pages, the brand or product name must be a hero-level signal, not just nav text or an eyebrow. No headline should overpower the brand.
- Brand test: If the first viewport could belong to another brand after removing the nav, the branding is too weak.
- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).
- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, images, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.
- Full-bleed hero only: On landing pages and promotional surfaces, the hero image should be a dominant edge-to-edge visual plane or background by default. Do not use inset hero images, side-panel hero images, rounded media cards, tiled collages, or floating image blocks unless the existing design system clearly requires it.
- Hero budget: The first viewport should usually contain only the brand, one headline, one short supporting sentence, one CTA group, and one dominant image. Do not place stats, schedules, event listings, address blocks, promos, "this week" callouts, metadata rows, or secondary marketing content in the first viewport.
- No hero overlays: Do not place detached labels, floating badges, promo stickers, info chips, or callout boxes on top of hero media.
- Cards: Default: no cards. Never use cards in the hero. Cards are allowed only when they are the container for a user interaction. If removing a border, shadow, background, or radius does not hurt interaction or understanding, it should not be a card.
- One job per section: Each section should have one purpose, one headline, and usually one short supporting sentence.
- Real visual anchor: Imagery should show the product, place, atmosphere, or context. Decorative gradients and abstract backgrounds do not count as the main visual idea.
- Reduce clutter: Avoid pill clusters, stat strips, icon rows, boxed promos, schedule snippets, and multiple competing text blocks.
- Use motion to create presence and hierarchy, not noise. Ship at least 2-3 intentional motions for visually led work.
- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.
- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile.
- For React code, prefer modern patterns including useEffectEvent, startTransition, and useDeferredValue when appropriate if used by the team. Do not add useMemo/useCallback by default unless already used; follow the repo's React Compiler guidance.

Exception: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.


## Commit Message

所有 commit message **必须使用中文**，并遵循 [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) 格式：

```
<type>(<scope>): <中文描述>

[可选 body，中文详细说明]

[可选 footer]
```

### Type 列表

| Type | 说明 |
|------|------|
| `feat` | 新功能 |
| `fix` | 修复 bug |
| `refactor` | 重构（非新功能、非修复） |
| `docs` | 文档变更 |
| `test` | 添加或修改测试 |
| `chore` | 构建或辅助工具变动 |
| `perf` | 性能优化 |
| `style` | 代码格式调整（不影响逻辑） |
| `ci` | CI/CD 配置变动 |
| `build` | 构建系统或依赖变更 |

### 示例

- `feat(client): 添加设备发现功能`
- `fix(core): 修复数据包校验和计算错误`
- `refactor(transport): 统一串口和UDP传输层接口`
- `test(client): 补充登录流程的单元测试`
- `chore: 升级 .NET SDK 到 10.0.200`

### 规则

1. **标题行**：type + scope（可选）+ 中文描述，总长度不超过 72 字符
2. **描述**：用简明中文说明"做了什么"和"为什么做"，而非"怎么做的"
3. **禁止**使用英文 commit message，所有面向用户的内容必须为中文
