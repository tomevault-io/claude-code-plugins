Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

# AGENTS.md

Canonical instructions for any IDE or coding agent working in this repository.
Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and similar tools should start here.

This is **not** the product website LLM crawl file. That file is <https://premiere-pro-mcp.com/llms.txt>, generated in the separate website repository.

Adapter stubs (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.windsurf/rules/`, `.clinerules`, `.continue/rules/`, `.junie/guidelines.md`) point here. Keep those stubs thin; put durable guidance in this file or in a focused Cursor/Copilot path rule. Optional Cursor rule `.cursor/rules/jev-surfaces.mdc` scores CEP / UXP / claims file candidates. It is not a TypeSafe Jev sidecar protocol; do not add one here.

## What this repository is

Independent TypeScript [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that gives a compatible AI client structured control over supported **Adobe Premiere Pro** workflows. Display name: MCP for Adobe Premiere Pro. npm package: `premiere-pro-mcp`. MCP server name: `io.github.leancoderkavy/premiere-pro`.

It is not affiliated with Adobe. The only npm package published from this repo is `premiere-pro-mcp`.

Production path: local Node.js MCP server (stdio) talking to a **CEP** panel inside Premiere through private file-based IPC (`.jsx` command files and `.json` responses). **UXP** is a capability-aware preview backend for Premiere 25.6+ documented APIs. A failed UXP mutation must never be silently retried through CEP or the undocumented QE DOM.

The local stdio server is the product. The HTTP `/mcp` endpoint is an operator-managed transport, not a public remote-Premiere product. See `docs/hosted-mcp-product-boundary.md`.

## Canonical sources

Read only what the task needs. Current source and release metadata beat dated snapshots.

| Topic | Source |

| This agent map | `AGENTS.md` (this file) |
| Trust model and vulnerability reports | `SECURITY.md` |

| Registered tool catalog | `docs/supported-actions.md` (generated) |
| Product claims governance | `docs/claims-registry.md`, `docs/claims-registry.json` |
| Published-package facts | npm tarball, synced by [`leancoderkavy/premiere-pro-mcp-site`](https://github.com/leancoderkavy/premiere-pro-mcp-site) to <https://premiere-pro-mcp.com/facts/> |

| Claude Code develop skill | `claude-plugins/premiere-pro/skills/develop-premiere-pro-mcp/SKILL.md` |

Do not mix published-package counts with development-source counts. `docs/supported-actions.md` is the source catalog; the published npm artifact is what the website reports. In this repo the README `### Latest release:` heading anchors client version pins. A listed tool is not proof that a particular Premiere host supports it.

## Architecture

```text
AI client  --stdio MCP-->  Node server (src/server.ts)
                              |  CEP: write cmd_*.jsx, poll JSON  -->  cep-plugin  -->  ExtendScript / QE DOM
                              |  UXP: authenticated WebSocket     -->  uxp-plugin  -->  documented Premiere UXP
                              |  AE:  optional CEP                -->  after-effects-cep-plugin (MOGRT studio)
```

- `src/index.ts` — stdio entry.
- `src/http-server.ts` — Streamable HTTP `/mcp`. Requires `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` in production.
- `src/server.ts` — registers tools, resources, prompts; filters by authority and tool packs.
- `src/tools/` — one module per capability area; each exports `getXTools(...)`.
- `src/bridge/script-builder.ts` — ES3 ExtendScript helpers and `escapeForExtendScript`.
- `src/bridge/file-bridge.ts` — private temp-dir IPC for CEP.
- `src/bridge/uxp-websocket-bridge.ts` — authenticated UXP transport.
- `src/security/capabilities.ts` — `inspect`, `edit`, `export`, `filesystem`, `unsafe-script`.
- `src/ai/` — local planning/preview helpers. They do not call Adobe generative APIs.
- `src/workflows/` — tool packs, structured results, client-facing instructions, prompt catalog.
- `cep-plugin/` — production Premiere CEP panel.
- `uxp-plugin/` — Premiere 25.6+ UXP panel (CommonJS, Adobe ESLint plugin).
- `after-effects-cep-plugin/` — separate AE connector for guarded MOGRT recipes.
- `tests/` — Vitest. Mocks the bridge; does not prove live Premiere behavior.
- `scripts/` — inventories, catalogs, installers, publish helpers.

Premiere metadata is several host surfaces. Documented UXP `Metadata.*` methods
are already mapped. Project-panel column JSON, Premiere-private project metadata
XML, and file/clip XMP are distinct; `premiere://project/metadata` is only a
path-redacted project/timeline summary. Field-level inspect/update uses
`uxp.XMPMeta` / AdobeXMPScript with a 256-field cap, sensitive-EXIF omit, and
field readback; CEP can still accept a complete XML payload plus `updatedFields`.
Do not dump unbounded packets, wrap undocumented QE metadata, or promote C2PA
into production tools without a bounded contract and a stable host pin. Keep MCP
`agent-instructions.ts`, the workflow catalog, and both `edit-premiere-project`
skill copies in sync when this surface changes.

### How a CEP tool call works

1. Handler validates arguments in TypeScript.
2. It builds ES3 ExtendScript and embeds user strings only through `escapeForExtendScript`.
3. `sendCommand` writes a command file under a user-owned temp directory (mode `0700`).
4. The CEP panel executes via `CSInterface.evalScript` and writes a JSON result.
5. Mutating tools read Premiere state back and report `committed`, `verified`, `committed_unverified`, or failure. A host API return value alone is not success.

## Commands

Use Node.js 24 for repository work. Package engines floor: **Node.js 20.19+**. Install with `npm ci`.

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Install | `npm ci` |
| Watch compile | `npm run dev` |
| Build | `npm run build` |
| Unit tests | `npm test` |
| One test file | `npx vitest run tests/tools/timeline.test.ts` |
| Coverage (when changing coverage-sensitive code) | `npm run test:coverage` |
| Full gate (lint, inventories, build, tests) | `npm run check` |
| Install CEP panel | `npm run build` then `npm run install-cep` |

CI (`.github/workflows/cross-platform.yml`) runs `npm ci` and `npm run check` on Windows and macOS for Node 20, 22, and 24. Coverage is enforced on Windows / Node 22.

`npm run lint` currently lints `uxp-plugin/**/*.cjs` only.

## Hard constraints

### ExtendScript (CEP / AE generated scripts)

ExtendScript is ECMAScript 3. Generated host code must use `var`, traditional `function`, and `for` loops. Do not emit `let`, `const`, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, spread, default parameters, or `Array.forEach` / `map` / `filter`.

Escape every user-controlled string before embedding it:

```typescript
const script = buildToolScript(`
  var item = __findProjectItem("${escapeForExtendScript(args.item_id)}");
  if (!item) return __error("Item not found");
  return __result({ name: item.name });
`);
```

Never interpolate raw paths, names, expressions, or prompts into generated scripts.

### Authority and unsafe scripting

Default capabilities: `inspect,edit,export,filesystem`. `execute_extendscript`, `send_raw_script`, and `evaluate_expression` stay disabled unless `PREMIERE_MCP_CAPABILITIES` explicitly includes `unsafe-script`. Do not enable that capability to work around a missing tool.

### UXP vs CEP

Prefer documented Premiere APIs. QE DOM (`app.enableQE()`) is experimental; mark it in tool descriptions. UXP tools must honor the runtime capability probe. Do not fall back from a failed UXP mutation to CEP or QE.

### Verification and claims

- Mutating tools must verify postconditions with readback.
- Distinguish `committed`, `verified`, `committed_unverified`, and failed outcomes in user-visible results and docs.
- Automated tests prove package behavior only. Live Premiere claims need a supported host with the applicable CEP or UXP bridge running.
- Never claim a release, npm publish, Marketplace listing, deployment, or host-side validation unless that layer was directly verified.
- Do not invent testimonials, download rankings, or host compatibility.

### Telemetry and secrets

Telemetry is opt-in operational metadata only. Never collect prompts, arguments, results, tokens, IP addresses, project paths, media names, or person profiles. Do not weaken auth, private temp-directory ownership checks, script-size limits, or secret handling.

Keep `.env`, credentials, certificates, Premiere project/media files, `dist/`, coverage, and local diagnostics out of commits.

### Focused changes

Reuse existing helpers and module patterns. Do not rewrite unrelated files or bump lockfiles unless the task requires it. Preserve unrelated worktree changes.

## Adding or changing a tool

1. Find the right module in `src/tools/` (or add a module for a new capability area).
2. Export a `getXTools(...)` record. Each tool needs a description, JSON Schema `parameters` (every property described), and a handler.
3. Register new modules in `src/server.ts`.
4. If tests enumerate modules (see `tests/tools/tool-modules.test.ts`), add the module there.
5. Keep schemas, descriptions, registrations, structured results, authority, tests, `docs/supported-actions.md`, and reported counts synchronized. Regenerators: `npm run docs:supported-actions` and the inventory `:check` scripts inside `npm run check`.
6. Add tests for success, failure, escaping, validation, and authority.
7. After `npm run build`, restart the MCP client. Live-host verification is optional for schema work and required for compatibility claims.

## Testing expectations

- Vitest mocks `sendCommand` / UXP sockets. Green tests are not a Premiere proof.
- Coverage thresholds live in `vitest.config.ts` (statements 91, branches 90, functions 94, lines 93).
- Prefer the narrowest test file while iterating; run `npm run check` before calling the work done.

## Website

The marketing site (`premiere-pro-mcp.com`) lives in [`leancoderkavy/premiere-pro-mcp-site`](https://github.com/leancoderkavy/premiere-pro-mcp-site). It syncs published npm facts automatically (every 6 hours, or sooner when `npm-publish.yml` sends a `package-published` dispatch), so a release here needs no website change. This repo only serves the operator-managed MCP endpoint on `premiere-pro-mcp.fly.dev`; non-MCP paths there redirect to the site. Qualify README and docs claims per `docs/claims-registry.md`.

## What not to touch casually

- Generated inventories under `src/resources/*.json` and matching `docs/*-inventory.md` / drift docs — use the `npm run …:check` / generate scripts.
- Version strings: search package, lockfile, CEP/UXP manifests, marketplace, MCP config, updater, README and plugin pins, and installer files together.
- `.worktrees/` — local checkouts; do not commit.

## Release naming

Follow `docs/release-conventions.md`. GitHub release titles must equal their Git tags:
`v<SemVer>` (for example, `v1.19.0` or `v1.20.0-rc.1`). No product prefix or summary
suffix; summaries belong in release notes. Package and manifest versions omit `v`.
Keep the README `### Latest release:` heading and existing changelog format intact.
For historical cleanup, edit display titles only; never retag or republish versions.
Preview or check drift with `scripts/normalize-release-names.mjs`; apply authorized
title repairs with `--apply` and verify GitHub readback. New publication still needs
its own authorization and evidence. Keep both development skill copies aligned.

## Pull requests

Explain user impact and the compatibility boundary. Link the issue when one exists. Report exact checks run and whether live Premiere verification happened. Update `.github/pull_request_template.md` fields when adding tools.

<!-- output-style: caveman + i-have-adhd -->

## Output style

Always on for Cursor, Claude, and Codex, in every folder under `D:\Coding`. ADHD sets the shape. Caveman level **full** sets the wording. Code, commit messages, and pull request text stay normal prose.

Read and follow these skills when you need the full rules, an edge case, or a level switch:

- `D:\Coding\.agents\skills\i-have-adhd\SKILL.md`
- `D:\Coding\.agents\skills\caveman\SKILL.md`

1. First line is the next action, command, path, or answer.
2. Number multi-step work. One bounded action per step. Cap a visible list at 5 items.
3. End with one next action that takes under 2 minutes, when work remains.
4. Finish the current issue before opening another.
5. Restate progress when a task spans turns (`step 2 of 4 done`).
6. Time estimates use minutes or hours. After a change, show what now works.
7. Errors: location, cause, fix. No drama.
8. No preamble, no recap, no closer.
9. Wording: drop articles, filler, hedging, and pleasantries. Fragments are OK. Technical terms and code stay exact.
10. Use normal sentences for security warnings, irreversible confirmations, and steps whose order would be ambiguous as fragments. Explain in full when asked to explain. Confirm before destructive actions. After three failed fixes, name the doubtful assumption and ask one question.

Off switches: `stop caveman` turns wording off. `stop adhd mode` turns the shape off. `normal mode` turns both off. Confirm in one line, then drop that style. `/caveman lite|full|ultra` changes caveman intensity for the rest of the session.
