# engrene-memory-bridge

> - Follow Memory Bridge lifecycle protocol defined in AGENTS.md.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/engrene-memory-bridge/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

# GitHub Copilot Instructions (Compound Engineering + Memory Bridge)

## Project Rules
- Follow Memory Bridge lifecycle protocol defined in AGENTS.md.
- Read .memory-bridge/handoff.md before starting work.
- Maintain zero runtime dependencies and local-first storage.

## Active Decisions
- **[dec-mu7tvkhc] Independent Community Memory Bridge**: Adopt filesystem JSONL and Markdown contracts under .memory-bridge with zero runtime dependencies *(Impact: Full transparency, no vendor lock-in, cross-tool continuity between Claude, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity and Orca)*
- **[dec-mu7tvkjh] Hybrid Local Search Engine**: Combine BM25 term weighting with local embedded SQLite cosine similarity *(Impact: Fast, local, offline search without cloud LLM API dependencies)*
- **[dec-muc3rsh5] Obsidian Vault Export & JEV BM25 Hybrid Provider Support**: Added optional Obsidian vault sync (memory-bridge obsidian --vault <path>) exporting Markdown notes with YAML frontmatter and wikilinks, and added 'jev' semantic provider option for joint code-text search combined with BM25 SQLite FTS5. *(Impact: Expands memory-bridge export capabilities to Obsidian and improves semantic vector retrieval options.)*
- **[dec-mucoine1] Compound Engineering (CE) Multi-Agent Rules Synchronization**: Added 'memory-bridge ce' CLI command and core module (src/core/ce.ts) to automatically generate and sync AGENTS.md, .cursorrules, CLAUDE.md, and copilot-instructions.md with active decisions and pitfalls. *(Impact: Ensures all AI assistants automatically inherit project decisions, memory lifecycle protocols, and pitfalls without manual prompt editing.)*
- **[dec-mucplvwt] Automatic Multi-Agent & Obsidian Sync Triggers**: Added automatic integration execution (src/core/auto-sync.ts) triggered on 'decision add', 'log', and 'handoff build' events to keep Compound Engineering files and Obsidian vaults in sync automatically. *(Impact: Eliminates manual sync steps and keeps rule files and Obsidian notes updated in real-time.)*
- **[dec-mudge6ri] Obsidian vault import is bidirectional, vault wins by default**: Added 'memory-bridge obsidian import' and 'obsidian sync' (import then export). Decisions match by frontmatter id; notes without id get a generated id written back and export reuses the user's file name. Sessions match by ts+tool. Conflicts resolved by --prefer vault (default) or bridge; updates replace the JSONL record in place (same id, no duplicate). Redaction runs on import. config.integrations.obsidian.autoImport pulls before resume. loadConfig now preserves the integrations block (it was silently dropped before, so vaultDir/autoSync from config.json never applied). *(Impact: src/core/obsidian.ts (parser + importObsidianVault), src/core/store.ts (replaceDecisionEvent/replaceSessionEvent), src/core/config.ts (normalizeIntegrations), CLI obsidian subcommands, SPEC §8.1. Handoff.md stays export-only.)*
- **[dec-mudi62tf] This repository commits its own .memory-bridge/ (selective .gitignore)**: Track config.json, decisions.jsonl, sessions/*.jsonl, handoff.md and project-context.md in Git; ignore only vector.sqlite, .lock and observations/. Every log/decision/handoff change is committed together with the code. redaction.customPatterns redacts IPv4(:port); hostnames and SSH aliases are not covered, so never put server names in summaries (the repo is public). *(Impact: .gitignore, src/core/config.ts ensureGitignoreEntry, src/core/redaction.ts detectLeakageRisk, README portability section. Working tree gets dirty after any memory write; commit it.)*
