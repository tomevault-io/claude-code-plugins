# Agent guide compatibility pointer

Documentation version: `v1.1.0`

Canonical agent guide: [`docs/AGENTS.md`](docs/AGENTS.md)

Documentation map and repository ownership:
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)

Shared UI synchronization workflow:
[`docs/SHARED_UI_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/SHARED_UI_WORKFLOW.md)

Shared typography contract:
[`../shared_docs/SHARED_UI_TYPOGRAPHY_CONTRACT.md`](../shared_docs/SHARED_UI_TYPOGRAPHY_CONTRACT.md)

The following safety rules apply before reading the canonical guide:

- Preserve unrelated user changes; the worktree may be intentionally dirty.
- Never delete or rewrite local market data, broker credentials, or `settings_store/` without explicit instruction.
- Never write synthetic, fabricated, placeholder, sample, demo, E2E, or debugging records into production stores.
- IBKR is file-import-only; do not add direct broker transports, sessions, credentials, market-data, or order-routing integrations.
- Do not alter live-order authorization or default PIN behavior without explicit instruction.
- Preserve `UniversNextforHSBC.ttc` as the sole Western typeface source and do not
  restore a platform, generic Western, or monospace font bypass. Follow the shared
  typography contract before changing fonts, typography tokens, or generated faces.
