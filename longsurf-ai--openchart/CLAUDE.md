# openchart

> Prefer simple designs and one source of truth. Read the owning directory's

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/openchart/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

# OpenChart

Prefer simple designs and one source of truth. Read the owning directory's
AGENTS.md and [architecture](docs/architecture/code-organization.md) before editing.

## Boundaries

- Desktop hosts the server; shared code never imports platforms. Common never
  imports app/server. App's server imports are type-only contracts.
- Features compose at the app root. Tea remains independent; product bindings
  belong in server. Follow existing owner patterns and descriptive names.
- Effect errors live at their owner. Before Effect changes, read
  [Effect's guide](node_modules/effect/AGENTS.md).
- Read [app/DESIGN.md](app/DESIGN.md) before UI changes. Use Computer Use for
  desktop verification. Draw diagrams in fenced Mermaid blocks.

## Commands and documentation

Run commands from the repository root through `just`: `install`, `desktop`,
`check`, `format-fix`. `just check` must pass before opening a PR.
Public APIs need self-contained TSDoc covering behavior, ownership, cleanup,
failures, and examples. Keep local AGENTS.md files under 200 words.

## Public content

Keep credentials, internal plans, and machine-local state outside this repository.
Authored prose uses English; real market identifiers and Unicode tests keep their
original text. Preserve human annotations between HUMAN-ANNOTATION markers:
only formatting changes are allowed without explicit human authorization;
wording, meaning, marker, location, or scope changes require it.
