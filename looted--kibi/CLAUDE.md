> Kibi capability-based discovery-first workflow and KB mutation discipline

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/kibi-workflow/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


Use Kibi via MCP tools when available, or via CLI JSON routes when MCP is unavailable.

Interface selection:
1. If any `kb_*` or `kibi_kb_*` tool is in the tool list, use MCP only. Do not use the CLI path.
2. Else if Shell (or equivalent) is available and the project-local CLI is trusted, run the non-installing JSON recipe below. Missing MCP tools does not mean Kibi is unavailable.
3. Else stop and tell the operator. Do not probe the CLI, do not install packages, and do not infer MCP availability from config file existence.
4. Shell is in-policy only for the trusted project-local `npx --no-install kibi ...` (or `bunx --no-install kibi ...`) command when step 2 applies.
5. Never use a global fallback, an installing runner, or an unapproved route. Do not read or edit `.kb/` files directly.

CLI JSON recipe (stdin is one UTF-8 JSON object):

```bash
printf '%s\n' '{"query":"checkout","limit":10}' | npx --no-install kibi search --input -
```

Map canonical MCP names to CLI routes by dropping the `kb_` prefix and replacing `_` with `-` (`kb_search` → `search`, `kb_find_gaps` → `find-gaps`, `kb_query` → `query`, `kb_status` → `status`, `kb_check` → `check`, `kb_upsert` → `upsert`).

Discovery workflow:
- Start with `kb_search` for broad discovery.
- Follow with `kb_query` for exact entities, filters, and source-linked lookups.
- Use `kb_status`, `kb_find_gaps`, `kb_coverage`, and `kb_graph` when reporting questions need them.

Mutation workflow:
- Query before mutate.
- Create relationship endpoints before linking.
- Use `kb_upsert` sequentially. Run `kb_check` before completion.
- Use `kb_delete` only for intentional removals with dependency awareness.

Completion must state KB freshness outcome: updated, no-impact with rationale, or deferred/failed.
