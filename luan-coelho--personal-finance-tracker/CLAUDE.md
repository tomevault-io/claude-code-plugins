## Analysis Process

Before responding to any request, follow these steps:

1. Request Analysis
   - Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, etc.)
   - Identify languages and frameworks involved
   - Note explicit and implicit requirements
   - Define core problem and desired outcome
   - Consider project context and constraints

2. Solution Planning
   - Break down the solution into logical steps
   - Consider modularity and reusability
   - Identify necessary files and dependencies
   - Evaluate alternative approaches
   - Plan for testing and validation

3. Implementation Strategy
   - Choose appropriate design patterns
   - Consider performance implications
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Verify best practices alignment

## Code Style and Structure

### General Principles

- Write concise, readable TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability
- Structure components logically: exports, subcomponents, helpers, types

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (handleClick, handleSubmit)
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components

### TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead
- Implement proper type safety and inference
- Use `satisfies` operator for type validation

## React 19 and Next.js 15 Best Practices

### Component Architecture

- Favor React Server Components (RSC) where possible
- Minimize 'use client' directives
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Suspense for async operations
- Optimize for performance and Web Vitals

### State Management

- Use `useActionState` instead of deprecated `useFormState`
- Leverage enhanced `useFormStatus` with new properties (data, method, action)
- Implement URL state management with 'nuqs'
- Minimize client-side state
- always use react query for api calls

### Async Request APIs

```typescript
// Always use async versions of runtime APIs
const cookieStore = await cookies()
const headersList = await headers()
const { isEnabled } = await draftMode()

// Handle async params in layouts/pages
const params = await props.params
const searchParams = await props.searchParams
```

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use named functions instead of constants, e.g. “function toggle(){}”. Also, define a type if possible.
- use react query for fetch calls.
- Avoid suggesting any kind of caching in fetch or route.
- When creating new ts or js files, use Kebab Case, for example "user-form.ts" instead of "userForm.ts".
- When creating functions that need to make calls via POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE methods, use react query with mutations for cleaner code.
- Do not insert console.log() or console.error() in the code.

### technology-versions

Always use the following library versions:
- Nodejs: 20
- React: 19
- Next.js: 15
- TypeScript: 5
- TailwindCSS: 4
- shadcn/ui: latest compatible with Tailwind 4
