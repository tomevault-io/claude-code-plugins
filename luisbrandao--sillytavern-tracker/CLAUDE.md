# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `index.js` wires SillyTavern events, generation mutex listeners, and slash commands into the extension entry point.
- Core logic under `src/`: `tracker.js` orchestrates generation/injection, `generation.js` handles independent connection requests, `trackerDataHandler.js` manages schema reconciliation, and `ui/` + `settings/` hold modals, previews, and defaults.
- Shared helpers live in `lib/` (`utils.js`, `interconnection.js`, `ymlParser.js`); reuse them before adding new utilities.
- `lib/ymlParser.js` is a thin wrapper over SillyTavern's bundled `yaml` package (`import { yaml } from "../../../../../lib.js"`); the old hand-rolled parser corrupted commas/`#`/quotes/types. Despite the legacy name, `yamlToJSON()` returns the parsed OBJECT (and throws on garbage); `jsonToYAML()` emits standard block-style YAML, so newly serialized trackers look different from old inline-array YAML but both parse fine.
- UI assets remain in `html/settings.html`, `sass/style.scss`, and compiled `style.css`. Treat `docs/Tracker Documentation.pdf` as legacy; rely on `README.md` for current behaviour.

## Build, Test & Development Commands
- `npx sass sass/style.scss style.css --no-source-map` rebuilds stylesheets (`--watch` for live edits). `sass/style.scss` is the source of truth — edit the SCSS, never hand-edit the compiled `style.css`. (The SCSS was resynced to the compiled output in 2026-06; it now includes the tracker-interface layout under the correct DOM id `#trackerEnhancedInterface`, prompt-maker drag/drop, template-controls, reset, and compatibility rules.)
- dart-sass emits two harmless normalizations vs. older builds: a leading `@charset "UTF-8";` (the compatibility indicators use emoji) and unquoted emoji attribute selectors (`[value*=✅]`); both are valid and render identically.
- After JS/HTML/CSS changes reload via SillyTavern `Settings → Extensions → Reload`.
- In the browser console inspect `window.trackerEnhanced` to view runtime state or toggle debug logging.

## Coding Style & Conventions
- ES modules, double quotes, trailing semicolons. Core logic uses tabs; selective UI helpers use four spaces—match the file.
- Naming: PascalCase classes, camelCase functions/vars, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE constants, DOM IDs prefixed with `tracker_enhanced_`.
- Use provided `debug/log/warn/error` helpers for console output so debug mode can silence them globally.

## Tracker Behaviour Notes (2025-09)
- Tracker auto-generation hooks fire from `onGenerateAfterCommands` and the message-rendered callbacks (`onUserMessageRendered`/`onCharacterMessageRendered`). The old `onMessageSent/Received` handlers were retired when generation moved to post-response (commit 5b4629c) and have been deleted. SillyTavern emits a `generation_after_commands` dry-run immediately after `chat_id_changed`; we now bail early and log `GENERATION_AFTER_COMMANDS dry run skip { type: "normal", dryRun: true, ... }` to confirm no request is sent.
- The first real turn after a reload still fires a second `generation_after_commands` with `dryRun: false`. Look for the log payload `(3) [undefined, options, false]` before tracker generation starts. If that never appears, reload the extension to clear stale `chat_metadata`.
- `addTrackerToMessage` writes tracker data before the DOM exists; previews/interface updates must run in `onUserMessageRendered`/`onCharacterMessageRendered`. Skipping those handlers after a tracker exists hides UI updates.
- When investigating tracker gaps, capture the full console sequence (chat open → user turn → character reply). Two sequential generation calls are expected in single-stage mode: one for the previous message, one for the newly rendered message. Only unexpected dry-run omissions should be treated as regressions.

## Injection & Prompt Pipeline Notes (2026-06)
- `injectTracker()` uses `setExtensionPrompt(..., IN_CHAT, depth, true, role)` with the role from the `trackerInjectionRole` setting. For chat completion APIs the injection becomes its own `{role, content}` message via core's `populationInjectionPrompts()` (`public/scripts/openai.js`), NOT `doChatInject()` (text completion only).
- A "separate tracker message" cannot be guaranteed on alternation-enforcing backends: ST's server (`src/prompt-converters.js`, e.g. `convertClaudeMessages`/`mergeMessages`) converts mid-chat `system` messages to `user` and then unconditionally merges consecutive same-role messages. So System/User-role injections get glued into the player's user turn there — that is core server behavior, not an extension bug; don't try to refactor it away client-side.
- Assistant role is the only option that keeps the tracker out of the player's turn on those backends (it merges into the end of the character's previous message; on OpenAI-compatible APIs it stays separate). `injectTracker()` clamps assistant-role injections to depth ≥ 1 because a trailing assistant message acts as a Claude prefill and the model continues writing from the tracker.
- Experimental `trackerToolInjection` setting (2026-09, branch `tool-injection`): presents the tracker as a completed tool call instead of text. `injectTracker()` blanks the text injection and stashes the serialized tracker in `src/toolInjection.js`; the `CHAT_COMPLETION_PROMPT_READY` handler then splices `{role: assistant, tool_calls: [get_scene_state]}` + `{role: tool, content}` after the player's turn (before a trailing assistant continue/prefill message). A `get_scene_state` tool is registered via `ToolManager` so the `tools` array carries its definition when ST's function calling is enabled, and a genuine model-initiated call returns the same payload. Needs prompt post-processing None or a `_tools` variant: the plain variants convert `tool` to `user` and strip `tool_calls` (`mergeMessages` in core `src/prompt-converters.js`). Chat completion only; text completion falls back to the text block. The handler checks `oai_settings.custom_prompt_post_processing` first: under a `(no tools)` variant it pushes the classic `<tracker>` text block as a user message and toasts once per session, because the mangled pair (empty assistant + tracker glued into a user message) is what the first live test produced. ST's "unsupported by the current model" icon on Enable function calling is driven by the same dropdown (`ToolManager.isToolCallingSupported()`), not by the model. The pair is added after the prompt manager runs, so it is not counted against the token budget. Rationale: models are trained to treat tool results as external data they neither authored nor echo, which is exactly the framing the tracker wants.

## Tracker Semantics (2026-09)
- **Post-state.** `chat[N].tracker` describes the scene AFTER message N. `addTrackerToMessage(N)` calls `generateTracker(N)`: the agent sees the chat up to and including N, `{{message}}` is N's text, and the "current tracker" shown to the agent is the last one strictly before N (`getCurrentTracker()` uses `getLastMessageWithTracker(N - 1)`). The MERGE base for fields the agent was not asked about (`updateTracker()` in `generateTracker()`) is N's own tracker when it already has a valid one, else the one before N: a "Static Only"/"No Static Fields" regeneration or a stale-swipe refresh must keep the fields it did not touch (regressed between 1.6.0 and 2.0.0, when the base was always N-1 and "Static Only" reset N's dynamic fields to the previous message's). Swipes never inherit replaced text because the redo path deletes the target's tracker before regenerating. Same convention for `/tracker-enhanced-generate message=N` and the interface's Regenerate button.
- Until 1.5.x the semantics were pre-state (`generateTracker(N-1)` saved on N: the world before N), a leftover from when the tracker was generated up front to guide the reply. After generation was deferred (5b4629c) that meant a fresh reply with target Character was injected with a state two messages old, and swipe/regenerate re-injected the tracker of the text being replaced. Old chats are not migrated: their trackers are off by one and superseded by the first post-state one.
- **Selection** (`handleStagedGeneration`): `nowSlot` = the player's message just sent for a fresh reply, or the message before the target for continue/swipe/regenerate. Inject `getLastMessageWithTracker(nowSlot)`. Redo types `delete` the target's own tracker first so `addTrackerToMessage()` regenerates it for the new text; a truthy-but-invalid leftover (`{}` / default-only tracker) used to short-circuit the fallback and inject nothing (found via `Tracker selection` log, 2026-09).
- The `tempTrackerId`/`tempTracker` stash is gone (it also silently swallowed generation for any other rendered message when stale). `/tracker-enhanced-override` and the manual popup now write straight to `nowSlot`.
- Manual saves from the tracker interface (`saveTracker()` structured, `saveTrackerRaw()` raw tab, both in `trackerDataHandler.js`) call `stampManualTracker()`, which sets `trackerSwipeId` to the current swipe and clears `trackerDirty`, otherwise `ensureFreshTracker()` would regenerate over a hand edit made after navigating swipes. `saveTrackerRaw()` deliberately skips the merge with the previous tracker (removed fields stay removed) and only normalizes through `getTracker(..., ALL, includeUnmatchedFields=true)`.
- **Generation target User is the recommended default**: the player's message gets its tracker when it renders (the render handler runs inside `GENERATION_AFTER_COMMANDS` because the mutex is re-entrant for this extension), so the reply is generated with the complete state and blocks for one agent call. Swipes/regenerates/continues reuse that tracker, so they cost nothing and need no per-swipe storage. With Character/Both, assistant trackers are per message, not per swipe (`chat[N].tracker` is not in ST's `swipe_info`): generating a new swipe drops the message's tracker and regenerates it for the new text, but navigating back to an older swipe fires no `GENERATION_AFTER_COMMANDS` and no `CHARACTER_MESSAGE_RENDERED` (ST only emits the latter for the newest swipe, `addOneMessage` checks `swipe_id === swipes.length - 1`), so by itself the message would keep the tracker of the LAST GENERATED swipe while showing the older text. Solved lazily (1.6.1): `saveTrackerOnMessage()` records `chat[N].trackerSwipeId = swipe_id`, `MESSAGE_EDITED` sets `chat[N].trackerDirty`, and `ensureFreshTracker(N)` regenerates a stale tracker right before it is used, both as the injected source in `handleStagedGeneration` and as the base (`getLastMessageWithTracker(N-1)`) in `addTrackerToMessage`. Navigating swipes and editing cost nothing; the next send that depends on the message pays one regeneration for the swipe/text actually shown. Trackers without the marker (pre-1.6.1) count as clean. No `MESSAGE_SWIPED` listener is needed.

## Tracker Agent Request Layout (2026-09, 2.0.0)
- `buildTrackerAgentMessages()` in `src/generation.js` builds every tracker-agent request (single-stage, and both stages of two-stage) as four chat messages: `system` = system template rendered by `getSystemPrompt()`; `user` = context template rendered with `recentMessages` up to `mesNum - 1`; `assistant` = `<tracker>` + `getCurrentTracker(mesNum)` (state before `mesNum`) + `</tracker>`, i.e. the agent's own previous output; `user` = request template via `getRequestPrompt()`, with the analysed message auto-prepended as `### Latest Message` when the template has neither `{{message}}` nor `{{latestMessage}}`. Order user/assistant/user keeps alternation-enforcing backends happy without placeholders.
- `sendIndependentGenerationRequest()` accepts a string or a messages array; core's `ConnectionManagerRequestService.sendRequest()` passes arrays through for chat completion and `TextCompletionService.processRequest()` renders them with the profile's instruct template (`Array.isArray(prompt)` branch in `public/scripts/custom-request.js`). The `generateRaw` fallback flattens the turns with blank lines.
- Legacy templates: the old defaults carried Llama 3 control tokens (`<|begin_of_text|>`, `<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>`, `<|eot_id|>`), `<!-- Start/End of ... -->` comments, `{{trackerSystemPrompt}}` at the top and a `### Current Tracker <tracker>{{currentTracker}}</tracker>` block. `cleanPromptPiece()` strips the tokens/comments and the hollow current-tracker block; the moved macros (`trackerSystemPrompt`, `messageSummarizationSystemPrompt`, `currentTracker`) are blanked in the context vars. `migrateLegacyTemplates()` (settings.js) swaps saved templates that still equal a pre-2.0 default (kept verbatim in `legacyTemplates`, defaultSettings.js) for the new default; customised templates are not touched.
- Inline mode was removed in 2.0.0 (`migrateRetiredInlineMode()` moves settings/presets to single-stage and drops `Default-Inline` / `inlineRequestPrompt`). `removeTrackerFromMessage()` still strips a legacy inline `<tracker>` block from message text.
- Size profile of a real single-stage request before 2.0 (48k chars): recent messages with embedded trackers 13.6k, Tech-Summarize session characters 12k, world info 11.5k, three example trackers 3.5k, rules 3.3k. The layout change does not cut content; embedded per-message trackers (`generateRecentMessagesTemplate`) and unfiltered WI are the next candidates.

## Testing Workflow
- Manual validation only: stage chats, send user/character turns, run `/tracker save`, inspect preview pane, and watch console for `[tracker-enhanced]` logs or unexpected mutex captures.
- For regression checks, confirm both standalone tracker interface updates and inline preview rendering for freshly generated messages.

## Commit & PR Expectations
- Follow history style: short imperative titles (e.g., `add createAndJoin`).
- PRs should note motivation, UX impact, preset migration steps, and link relevant SillyTavern changes. Include screenshots or YAML snippets if UI output changes.
- **Bump `version` in `manifest.json`** whenever you ship user-facing changes (features/fixes). Use semver: patch for fixes, minor for new features, major for breaking changes (removed fields/defaults). SillyTavern surfaces this version, so don't forget it before release.

## Migration Context
- Development moved from Claude to Codex agents. Keep AGENTS.md updated with key learnings (like the tracker generation findings above) so future compactions retain context.
