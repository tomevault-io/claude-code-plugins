# nextjs16-project-structure

> Below is a **production-grade Cursor Project Rule** for **Next.js 16 project structure** based on the official documentation you provided, but rewritten as **strict architectural rules** (including anti-patterns).

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/nextjs16-project-structure/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

Below is a **production-grade Cursor Project Rule** for **Next.js 16 project structure** based on the official documentation you provided, but rewritten as **strict architectural rules** (including anti-patterns).

This rule is designed to **standardize large Next.js codebases** and prevent Cursor from generating messy folder structures.

Place it at:

```
.cursor/rules/nextjs16-project-structure.mdc
```

# Next.js 16 Project Structure Rules

This rule enforces **consistent project structure and file conventions** for all Next.js 16 applications.

The goal is to ensure:

- scalable architecture
- predictable routing
- maintainable codebases
- compatibility with Next.js 16 features

All generated code must follow these structural rules.

---

# 1. Required Root Structure

Every project must follow this structure.

```

/
app/
components/
lib/
services/
actions/
types/
public/
next.config.ts
package.json
tsconfig.json

```

Optional:

```

src/

```

If `src` is used:

```

src/app
src/components
src/lib

```

ever mix both patterns.

---

# 2. The `app` Directory

The `app` directory defines the **routing system**.

Rules:

- Every folder represents a **route segment**
- A route becomes public only when it contains:

```

page.tsx

```

or

```

route.ts

```

Allowed files in route segments:

```

layout.tsx
page.tsx
loading.tsx
error.tsx
not-found.tsx
template.tsx
route.ts
default.tsx

```

Never place random files at the route root.

---

# 3. Root Layout Requirement

The root layout must exist:

```

app/layout.tsx

```

This layout must define:

```

<html>
<body>
```

Example structure:

```
app/
  layout.tsx
  page.tsx
```

Without a root layout the application is invalid.

---

# 4. Route File Hierarchy

The rendering hierarchy must follow this order:

1. layout.tsx
2. template.tsx
3. error.tsx
4. loading.tsx
5. not-found.tsx
6. page.tsx

Never attempt to bypass this hierarchy.

---

# 5. Dynamic Routes

Dynamic segments must use brackets.

Examples:

```
app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
app/shop/[...slug]/page.tsx
app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx
```

Rules:

`[slug]` → single parameter
`[...slug]` → catch-all
`[[...slug]]` → optional catch-all

Parameters must be accessed asynchronously:

```
const { slug } = await params
```

Never access params synchronously.

---

# 6. Route Groups

Route groups organize routes **without affecting the URL**.

Syntax:

```
(folderName)
```

Example:

```
app/(marketing)/page.tsx
app/(shop)/cart/page.tsx
```

Use route groups for:

* separating product areas
* separate layouts
* large app organization

Never use route groups as a replacement for normal folders.

---

# 7. Private Folders

Private folders start with `_`.

Example:

```
app/blog/_components
app/blog/_lib
```

Purpose:

* colocated utilities
* internal UI
* helpers

Private folders are **never routable**.

Rules:

Never place `page.tsx` inside private folders.

---

# 8. Colocation Rules

Next.js allows colocating files inside route segments.

Example:

```
app/blog/
  page.tsx
  _components/
    PostCard.tsx
  _lib/
    getPosts.ts
```

Only the output of:

```
page.tsx
route.ts
```

is exposed publicly.

Everything else remains internal.

---

# 9. API Routes

APIs must use the `route.ts` convention.

Example:

```
app/api/users/route.ts
```

Bad:

```
app/api/users.ts
pages/api/*
```

Handlers must export HTTP methods:

```
export async function GET() {}
export async function POST() {}
```

---

# 10. Parallel Routes

Parallel routes use the `@slot` pattern.

Example:

```
app/dashboard/
  @analytics/page.tsx
  @team/page.tsx
```

Every slot **must include a default.tsx fallback**.

Example:

```
@analytics/default.tsx
```

If not needed:

```
return null
```

---

# 11. Intercepting Routes

Intercepting routes allow rendering routes inside other layouts.

Patterns:

```
(.)folder
(..)folder
(..)(..)folder
(...)folder
```

Typical usage:

* modal navigation
* previews
* overlays

These should only be used for UI routing patterns.

---

# 12. Metadata Files

Metadata files must follow official naming conventions.

Allowed examples:

```
favicon.ico
icon.png
apple-icon.png
opengraph-image.png
twitter-image.png
robots.txt
sitemap.xml
```

Dynamic metadata can be generated using:

```
opengraph-image.ts
twitter-image.ts
sitemap.ts
robots.ts
```

Never invent custom metadata filenames.

---

# 13. Public Assets

Static assets must live in:

```
public/
```

Example:

```
public/images/logo.png
public/fonts/inter.woff2
```

Access via:

```
/images/logo.png
```

Never import assets from outside `public`.

---

# 14. Configuration Files

Required configuration files:

```
next.config.ts
package.json
tsconfig.json
eslint.config.mjs
```

Optional but recommended:

```
instrumentation.ts
proxy.ts
.env.local
```

Never commit:

```
.env
.env.local
.env.production
```

---

# 15. Components and Shared Code

Shared code must live outside routing.

Recommended structure:

```
components/
lib/
services/
actions/
types/
hooks/
```

Responsibilities:

components → UI
lib → utilities
services → server logic
actions → server actions
types → TypeScript types

Never place business logic inside React components.

---

# 16. Absolute Rule

Routing structure must remain predictable.

Do not:

* mix Pages Router with App Router
* invent new routing file conventions
* expose internal utilities as routes
* place business logic inside route files

Follow the official Next.js conventions strictly.

```

---

✅ This rule ensures Cursor **never generates chaotic structures** like:

```

app/utils/
app/components/
app/helpers/

```

or:

```

pages/api/*
