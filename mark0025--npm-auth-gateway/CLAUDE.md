## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/nextjs16-server-client-boundaries/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

Below is a **Next.js-16-correct rule** that avoids deprecated patterns and enforces the **App Router + React Server Components model**.

This rule should live at:

# Next.js 16 Server and Client Component Architecture

This rule defines how Server Components and Client Components must be used in a Next.js 16 application.

Next.js 16 uses **React Server Components (RSC)** by default. All pages, layouts, and components should remain **Server Components unless client behavior is required**.

The primary goal is to:

- minimize client JavaScript
- protect secrets
- fetch data on the server
- maintain fast streaming rendering

---

# 1. Default: Server Components

All components must be **Server Components by default**.

This includes:

```

app/page.tsx
app/layout.tsx
app/**/page.tsx
app/**/layout.tsx

````

Server Components allow:

- server-side data fetching
- access to environment variables
- access to API keys
- reduced client bundle size
- streaming UI rendering

Example:

```tsx
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetchData()
  return <div>{data.title}</div>
}
````

Never mark pages or layouts with `"use client"` unless absolutely required.

---

# 2. When to Use Client Components

Client Components must only be used when browser interactivity is required.

Use Client Components for:

* React state (`useState`)
* React effects (`useEffect`)
* event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`)
* browser APIs (`window`, `localStorage`, `navigator`)
* client hooks

Example:

```tsx
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
}
```

---

# 3. Client Boundary Rules

The `"use client"` directive creates a **client boundary**.

Once a file is marked with `"use client"`:

* all imports become part of the client bundle
* all child components become client-rendered

Rule:

Never place `"use client"` higher in the tree than necessary.

Bad:

```
app/layout.tsx
'use client'
```

Good:

```
app/ui/search.tsx
'use client'
```

Only the interactive component should be client-side.

---

# 4. Server → Client Data Flow

Data must flow **from Server Components to Client Components via props**.

Example:

Server Component:

```tsx
import LikeButton from './like-button'

export default async function Page() {
  const post = await getPost()

  return <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
}
```

Client Component:

```tsx
'use client'

export default function LikeButton({ likes }: { likes: number }) {
  return <button>{likes}</button>
}
```

Rules:

* Props must be **serializable**
* Do not pass database objects directly
* Do not pass functions

---

# 5. Interleaving Server and Client Components

Server Components may render Client Components.

Example:

```
Server Page
   ↓
Client Modal
   ↓
Server Content
```

Pattern example:

Server Component:

```tsx
import Modal from './modal'
import Cart from './cart'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Modal>
      <Cart />
    </Modal>
  )
}
```

Client Component:

```tsx
'use client'

export default function Modal({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

This pattern allows server-rendered UI to be nested inside interactive components.

---

# 6. Context Providers

React context **cannot run in Server Components**.

Context providers must be Client Components.

Example:

```
app/theme-provider.tsx
```

```tsx
'use client'

import { createContext } from 'react'

export const ThemeContext = createContext({})
```

Then imported into the root layout:

```
app/layout.tsx
```

```tsx
import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'
```

Providers should be placed **as deep as possible** in the tree.

Bad:

```
<html>
  <ThemeProvider>
```

Better:

```
<body>
  <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
```

---

# 7. Data Sharing With React.cache

Shared server data should use `React.cache`.

Example:

```
lib/user.ts
```

```ts
import { cache } from 'react'

export const getUser = cache(async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user')
  return res.json()
})
```

Rules:

* Cache expensive fetches
* Reuse cached functions across components
* Avoid duplicate requests during a single render

`React.cache` is scoped per request.

---

# 8. Streaming and Suspense

Server Components should use **Suspense boundaries** for streaming UI.

Example:

```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'

<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <Profile />
</Suspense>
```

This allows progressive rendering.

---

# 9. Prevent Environment Poisoning

Server-only code must never be imported into Client Components.

Example:

```
lib/data.ts
```

```ts
import 'server-only'
```

Use `server-only` when:

* accessing database
* accessing private APIs
* using environment secrets

Client-only modules may use:

```
client-only
```

to prevent server usage.

---

# 10. Third-Party Client Libraries

If a third-party library uses client features but lacks `"use client"`, wrap it.

Example wrapper:

```
app/carousel.tsx
```

```tsx
'use client'

import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default Carousel
```

Then use normally in Server Components.

---

# 11. Performance Rules

To maintain optimal performance:

Always:

* fetch data in Server Components
* keep client components small
* avoid unnecessary `"use client"`

Never:

* fetch database data in Client Components
* move entire pages to the client
* expose API keys to the browser

---

# 12. Absolute Rules

Never:

* add `"use client"` to layouts unnecessarily
* fetch secrets in client components
* run heavy logic in client components
* send non-serializable props to client components

Prefer:

```
Server Component → Client Component (interactive)
```

This architecture ensures minimal JavaScript and maximum performance.

```

---

# Recommended Next Rule (Very Important)

The next rule you should add is **data fetching discipline**, because Next.js 16 introduced **Cache Components and new caching APIs**.

The rule would be:

```

nextjs16-data-fetching-and-caching.mdc

```

This one teaches Cursor:

- `use cache`
- `revalidateTag(tag, 'max')`
- `updateTag()`
- request-time execution
- Partial Pre-Rendering
