# nextjs16feature-architecture

> Below is a **production-grade Cursor rule** for **feature-based architecture in Next.js 16**.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/nextjs16feature-architecture/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

Below is a **production-grade Cursor rule** for **feature-based architecture in Next.js 16**.
This rule teaches Cursor to generate **large-scale maintainable applications** instead of flat folder chaos.

This architecture is used in **large SaaS and enterprise Next.js apps** because it scales to **millions of users and large teams**.

Place it at:

```
.cursor/rules/nextjs16-feature-architecture.mdc

# Next.js 16 Feature Architecture Rules

This rule defines how to organize **large Next.js 16 applications** using **feature-based architecture** (also called domain architecture or vertical slicing).

The goal is to:

- prevent flat folder chaos
- scale to large applications
- isolate domains
- keep routing separate from business logic

This architecture should be used whenever the application contains **multiple domains or complex business logic**.

---

# 1. Architecture Philosophy

Next.js routing lives in `/app`, but business logic should be organized by **feature domains**.

Bad architecture:

```

components/
utils/
hooks/
services/

```

This becomes impossible to maintain at scale.

Instead use **domain modules**.

---

# 2. Domain Feature Structure

Each feature represents a **business domain**.

Example domains:

- auth
- users
- billing
- dashboard
- products
- analytics

Each feature must contain its own:

- components
- server logic
- actions
- types

Example structure:

```

features/
auth/
components/
actions/
services/
hooks/
types.ts
users/
components/
actions/
services/
types.ts

```

---

# 3. Relationship With App Router

The `/app` directory **only defines routing**.

Business logic should live inside **features**.

Example:

```

app/dashboard/page.tsx
features/dashboard/components/Dashboard.tsx

```

Page files should remain thin.

Bad:

```

app/dashboard/page.tsx
400 lines of UI + logic

```

Good:

```

app/dashboard/page.tsx

````

```tsx
import { DashboardPage } from "@/features/dashboard/components/dashboard-page"
````

---

# 4. Feature Folder Layout

Each feature must follow this structure:

```
features/
  feature-name/
    components/
    actions/
    services/
    hooks/
    lib/
    types.ts
```

Responsibilities:

components → UI
actions → server actions
services → business logic
hooks → client hooks
lib → utilities internal to the feature

Never place unrelated logic inside a feature.

---

# 5. Server Actions Inside Features

Server actions should live inside the feature.

Example:

```
features/users/actions/update-user.ts
```

Bad:

```
actions/update-user.ts
```

unless the action is globally shared.

---

# 6. Feature Components

Feature UI should live inside:

```
features/<feature>/components
```

Example:

```
features/dashboard/components/dashboard-page.tsx
features/dashboard/components/revenue-chart.tsx
```

Never place domain-specific UI in global `components/`.

---

# 7. Shared UI Components

Only **truly reusable UI** should live in the global components folder.

Examples:

```
components/button.tsx
components/modal.tsx
components/input.tsx
components/card.tsx
```

Rule:

If a component is used by only **one feature**, it belongs inside that feature.

---

# 8. Feature Services

Business logic must live in services.

Example:

```
features/users/services/user-service.ts
```

Responsibilities:

* database access
* external APIs
* domain logic

Never place business logic directly inside:

```
page.tsx
layout.tsx
components
```

---

# 9. Feature Types

Types must live inside the feature.

Example:

```
features/billing/types.ts
```

Global types should only be used when shared across domains.

Example:

```
types/global.ts
```

---

# 10. Feature Hooks

Client hooks belong to the feature.

Example:

```
features/analytics/hooks/use-metrics.ts
```

Bad:

```
hooks/useMetrics.ts
```

unless globally reusable.

---

# 11. Route to Feature Pattern

The correct pattern is:

```
app route → feature component → services/actions
```

Example flow:

```
app/dashboard/page.tsx
   ↓
features/dashboard/components/dashboard-page.tsx
   ↓
features/dashboard/services/dashboard-service.ts
```

This keeps routing separate from domain logic.

---

# 12. Feature Imports

Use absolute imports.

Example:

```
import { getUser } from "@/features/users/services/user-service"
```

Never use deep relative imports like:

```
../../../services/user-service
```

---

# 13. Large Feature Modules

Large features may contain nested domains.

Example:

```
features/billing/
  subscriptions/
  invoices/
  payments/
```

Each subdomain may contain its own:

```
components
services
actions
```

---

# 14. When NOT to Use Feature Architecture

Small projects can remain simple.

Feature architecture is recommended when:

* application exceeds 10–15 routes
* multiple teams work on the project
* application contains multiple domains
* significant server logic exists

---

# 15. Absolute Rules

Never generate:

```
utils/
helpers/
misc/
stuff/
```

These folders lead to architectural decay.

All logic must belong to either:

* a feature domain
* shared infrastructure
* the routing layer

---

# 16. Final Architecture Example

A production-grade Next.js 16 structure:

```
app/
components/
features/
  auth/
  dashboard/
  users/
  billing/
lib/
types/
public/
```

Routing lives in `app`.

Business domains live in `features`.

Shared infrastructure lives in `lib`.

This architecture scales cleanly as the application grows.

```

---

## Result

With these **three rules together**:

```

nextjs16-core-architecture.mdc
nextjs16-project-structure.mdc
nextjs16-feature-architecture.mdc

```

Cursor will now automatically generate **clean enterprise-grade Next.js architecture** instead of things like:

```

utils/
helpers/
hooks/
components/
services/
