# Project Guidelines

## Overview

Reference implementation for CI/CD in Microsoft Fabric. Demonstrates version control, deployment, and environment-specific configuration for Fabric workspace items using GitHub Actions and [fabric-cicd](https://microsoft.github.io/fabric-cicd).

## Project Layout

```
scripts/              Python CLI scripts (stdlib-only, Python 3.10+)
tests/                pytest unit tests
data/fabric/          Fabric item definitions (git-synced from Fabric workspaces)
.github/workflows/    GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
.github/instructions/ Path-specific Copilot instructions (Python, Actions)
```

## Build and Test

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

No build step — scripts are standalone CLI tools, not an installable package. `pyproject.toml` configures pytest only (`pythonpath = ["scripts"]`).

## Key Scripts

- `scripts/workspace_swap.py` — Swaps Fabric workspace IDs in tracked files between dev and a feature workspace, and provides a CI readiness check (`--check-ready`). Uses an **item type registry** pattern — new Fabric item types are added as config entries, not new functions.
- `scripts/workspace_swap.py --check-ready` — CI check for PR readiness (dev IDs present, no stray value sets).

## Fabric Item Types

Items fall into two categories based on how they reference environment resources:

- **Actual IDs** (SemanticModel, Notebook): Embed real workspace/lakehouse GUIDs. Must be rewritten by `workspace_swap.py` for feature branches and reverted before PR.
- **Logical IDs** (Ontology, DataAgent): Reference items via `.platform` `logicalId`, resolved by Fabric at runtime. Portable across Branch Out workspaces — no rewriting needed.

## CI/CD Configuration

- `data/fabric/parameter.yml` — Deploy-time `find_replace` rules for fabric-cicd. Maps dev IDs to dynamic placeholders (`$workspace.$id`, `$items.Lakehouse.*.$id`).
- `data/fabric/Patterns_Variables.VariableLibrary/` — Runtime configuration via value sets (Test, Prod, feature branches).

## Conventions

- Path-specific instructions in `.github/instructions/` govern Python and Actions code style — follow them.
- Never commit notebook META blocks containing internal metadata (security).
- Validate GUIDs from external sources before using them.
- Pin GitHub Actions to commit SHAs, not version tags.
- All file I/O must specify `encoding="utf-8"`.
- Local developer config goes in `.env` (gitignored). A committed `.env.sample` documents the expected keys. `scripts/workspace_swap.py` reads feature workspace IDs from `.env` when swapping to a feature workspace.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `check-pr-ready.yml` | PR to `dev` | Blocks merge if dev IDs not restored |
| `run-tests.yml` | PR (any branch) | Runs pytest when scripts/tests change |

## Translations

Translated documentation lives in `translations/<lang>/`, mirroring root filenames exactly (`fabric-hybrid-cicd-guide.md` → `translations/es/fabric-hybrid-cicd-guide.md`). English is canonical — fix the English source first, then mirror the fix.

- **Never translate** anything under `.github/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, or `data/`. Files in `.github/` are model input, not documentation.
- **Do not auto-translate** when editing an English doc. Translations are updated as separate reviewed work; a stale translation is a tracked task, not a merge blocker.
- When working in `translations/**`, `.github/instructions/translations.instructions.md` applies and carries the detailed rules. `TRANSLATION.md` is the full contract; each language's `GLOSARIO.md` and `GUIA-DE-ESTILO.md` hold its terminology and style decisions.

## Documentation

See `fabric-development-process.md` for the Branch Out workflow, item type reference table, and step-by-step swap-to-feature / swap-to-dev guides. See `fabric-hybrid-cicd-guide.md` for the deployment architecture.
