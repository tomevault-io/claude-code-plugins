# Project Guidelines

This is a caching project compatible with the Redis RESP protocol and implements the Raft consensus algorithm.

Every code change must preserve Redis protocol semantics, including:

* Argument parsing
* Command execution behavior
* Response generation

Every code change must avoid any noticeable performance regression. Do not introduce expensive or performance-intensive operations into the execution path of all commands merely to support a small number of commands.

Before modifying any code, read all design documents under the `docs` directory.

All Redis command implementations must be placed under the `protocol` directory.

Command implementations must use the appropriate trait based on their access pattern:

* Single-key reads must implement the `ReadCommand` trait.
* Multi-key reads must implement the `MultiReadCommand` trait.
* Single-key read-and-write commands must implement the `ComputeCommand` trait.
* Multi-key reads with a single-key write should implement the `MultiReadComputeCommand` trait.

These traits are designed to make it easier to perform the same set of operations during snapshot and restore.

If you notice bugs unrelated to the current modification, report them first instead of fixing them directly.

`src/mocha` contains the cache implementation for scheduled expiration based on a logical clock and timing wheel.

The system is still in alpha. Changes do not need to maintain compatibility with previous versions, including file version numbers and similar versioning concerns.
