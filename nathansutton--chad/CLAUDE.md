# AGENTS.md

chad is a local, single-user, Apple-Silicon coding agent: one MLX engine, one five-tool
surface, one agent loop. Why it is built this way is in `docs/design.md`; what each module
does, and which tests guard it, is the table in
[`docs/architecture.md#architecture-map`](docs/architecture.md#architecture-map). Read those before
proposing a redesign — this file does not repeat them.

## Gate

Run `make gate` before you call anything done. It runs four targets in order, and CI runs
the same four:

- `make lint` — `uv run ruff check src tests benchmarks`
- `make typecheck` — `uv run mypy src/chad benchmarks/polyglot`
- `make slop` — the vendored anti-slop linter (`tools/anti_slop`) over `src`, `tests`
  and `benchmarks`; stdlib-only, runs on its own 3.12 interpreter
- `make test` — `uv run pytest -q`, which loads no model and finishes in seconds

A green `make test` alone still fails the build if ruff, mypy or anti-slop is unhappy, so
run the whole gate. Run `make typecheck` **on macOS**: on Linux mlx is not installed,
`ignore_missing_imports` types every mlx symbol as `Any`, and the check passes vacuously
over exactly the engine and kernel modules it should guard.

The suite is model-free by default. `CHAD_MODEL_TESTS=1 uv run pytest -q
tests/test_engine.py` opts into the 0.5B proxy-model tier (first run downloads it); the
hybrid-cache tests additionally need `CHAD_TEST_HYBRID_MODEL` set to a local bf16 qwen3_5
model dir and skip without it.

## High-risk zones

Two areas corrupt more than the line you touched, so lean on the existing tests:

- **`engine.py` and `compaction.py`.** The shipped model's hybrid SSM/attention cache is
  **non-trimmable**: any change to the prefix forces a full re-prefill, and a bug here
  corrupts every later turn. Run `tests/test_engine.py` and `tests/test_compaction.py`.
- **The `run_turn` loop in `agent.py`.** The heart of the agent, guarded by
  `tests/test_agent_guards.py` and `tests/test_agent_e2e.py`, with tool/edit behavior in
  `tests/test_tools.py` and `tests/test_edit.py`.

## Model-visible changes need a conversation

Prompts, tool schemas, guardrails, the engine and compaction change **model-visible
behavior**, which the unit tests cannot measure. `benchmarks/polyglot` can, on your own
Mac: pin a pool of tasks a baseline passes only sometimes (`stats.py pool`, from a
published baseline via `fetch.py` or your own run with `--reps 2` or more), run that pool
on `main` and on your branch, and bring the `stats.py compare` output with the PR. Open an
issue describing the change first: a paired run costs a night, so agree on what it should
show before spending it.

## Dependency pins are load-bearing

The `mlx`, `mlx-lm`, `transformers` and `mcp` bounds in `pyproject.toml` are hand-gated
against this kernel stack and its loader, not resolver defaults — one of them excludes a
release that generates fluent garbage on these kernels, another a break that fails
silently through `getattr` defaults. Never widen a pin to satisfy a resolver: read the
comment above the bound you want to move, re-gate that release, then move it.

## Conventions

- ruff, mypy and anti-slop are the law. Match the surrounding comment density and naming,
  and write code that reads like the code already there.
- anti-slop bans the escape hatches a checker error tempts you into: no `Any`/`object`
  parameters or returns, no `dict[str, Any]`, no `getattr`/`setattr` by string, no
  `mock.patch`, and every `cast` or `# type: ignore[code]` carries a `# SAFETY: <why>`
  comment on its line or directly above. Name the contract instead: parse at the I/O
  boundary, declare the type, inject the seam. `make slop-review` reads back only the
  findings on lines your change touched, each with the recipe that replaces it;
  `uv run --python 3.12 --no-project python tools/anti_slop --explain <rule>` gives the
  reasoning. Pre-existing findings sit in `.anti-slop-baseline.json` and come back the
  moment their line is edited — fix them then. Never regenerate the baseline, add an
  `# anti-slop: ignore[...]`, or set a rule to `off` to make a new finding go away.
- Comments carry behavioural rationale only — no plan numbers, kata refs or benchmark
  references in code.
- The version lives in **both** `pyproject.toml` and `src/chad/__init__.py` and the two
  must match; see `RELEASING.md`.
- `plans/` at the repo root is where handoff plans live and is plan mode's only writable
  path; it is the user's to commit or ignore.
- `build/` and `*.egg-info` are regenerable artifacts; delete them before a repo-wide grep
  or a local wheel build.
