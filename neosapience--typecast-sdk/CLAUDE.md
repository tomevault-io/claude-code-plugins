> Core development guidelines for Typecast SDK development

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/sdk-development/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Typecast SDK Development Rules

## Backward Compatibility (CRITICAL)

All SDKs must maintain backward compatibility. Breaking changes are strongly discouraged.

- Do NOT remove or rename existing public APIs
- Do NOT change method signatures in ways that break existing code
- Use deprecation warnings before removing features
- Add new parameters as optional with sensible defaults
- When in doubt, maintain compatibility over introducing new patterns

## Cross-SDK Consistency

SDKs should maintain similar structure and API patterns across languages where feasible.

**However**, language-specific idioms and runtime characteristics take precedence:
- Follow each language's conventions and best practices
- Respect language-specific patterns (e.g., async/await in JS, goroutines in Go)
- Use native error handling mechanisms

## OpenAPI Specification

If an `openapi.json` file exists at the project root, use it as the **source of truth** for:
- API endpoint definitions
- Request/response schemas
- Model definitions
- Error codes and messages

## Code Quality Standards

### File Length Limit
Keep all source files under 450 lines. If a file exceeds this limit:
- Split into logical modules/classes
- Extract helper functions to separate files

### Comments and Documentation
**All comments must be written in English.** This includes:
- Inline code comments
- Function/method documentation
- README files and guides

### Security Requirements (CRITICAL)

- NO private keys, secrets, or credentials in code
- NO API keys committed to the repository
- Use `.env.example` files to document required environment variables
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use secure HTTP connections (HTTPS only)

## Pre-Commit Security Checklist (MUST CHECK ON EVERY COMMIT)

**This checklist MUST be reviewed before every commit. Failure to comply may result in security incidents.**

### 1. Security & Sensitive Information (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

Checking for hidden credentials in code is the top priority.

- [ ] **Secrets & API Keys**: Verify no AWS keys, DB credentials, API tokens, or other secrets are hardcoded
- [ ] **Configuration Files**: Ensure `.env`, `config.yaml`, `credentials.json`, and similar files are properly listed in `.gitignore`
- [ ] **Internal IPs & Domains**: Remove or generalize internal network IP addresses and private domain names that are not accessible externally

### 2. Commit History (Past Records Matter)

Remember that ALL past commits will be public, not just the current code.

- [ ] **Past Mistakes**: If security information was ever committed in the past, simply removing it from current files is NOT enough
- [ ] **History Cleanup**: Use tools like `git filter-repo` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to completely remove commits containing sensitive data, or create a new repository with only the current state as an 'Initial Commit'

### 3. Legal Review & Licensing

Legal basis is required when publishing corporate code assets.

- [ ] **Open Source License**: Decide on a license (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.) and add a LICENSE file. Without a license, others cannot legally use the code
- [ ] **Third-Party Libraries**: Verify that all libraries used in the project have licenses compatible with public release
- [ ] **Intellectual Property (IP)**: Ensure no core company technology or patent-related logic is included. Consult with legal team if available

## Additional Context

For complete guidelines, refer to [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) in the project root.
