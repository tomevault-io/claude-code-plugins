# grok-executor

> Only for an orchestrator session that has been asked to dispatch work to an executor CLI (cursor-agent or grok). A session started by a dispatch script is the executor, and this rule does not apply to it.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/grok-executor/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Executor dispatch

**If you were started by `.claude/skills/dispatch-cursor/dispatch.sh` or
`.claude/skills/dispatch-grok/dispatch.sh`, you are the executor: ignore this rule and follow
your task book.**

An orchestrator session drafts task books and hands implementation and investigation to a local
executor CLI; it keeps adjudication, git, databases, production and final acceptance.

- **cursor-agent** is the default executor since 2026-09-17: `.claude/skills/dispatch-cursor/`.
  It runs inside Cursor's kernel sandbox, which turns itself off without a word under `--force`,
  `approvalMode: "unrestricted"` or an allow-listed command. Dispatch only through its
  `dispatch.sh`, and trust a run only when `check.sh` finds the preflight line.
- **grok** is paused (balance exhausted, 402): `.claude/skills/dispatch-grok/`.

Read the chosen skill's `SKILL.md` before the first dispatch of a session.
