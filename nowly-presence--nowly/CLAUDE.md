# Button-styled links

When a control navigates (internal `Link` or external `<a>`), do **not** wrap it in a `Button` with `render={<Link />}` / `asChild` / `nativeButton={false}`.

Put `buttonVariants()` on the **real** `Link` or `<a>`. Never call `buttonVariants()` inside a React Server Component: Next treats that function as a client export. Use a small client wrapper that still renders `Link` / `<a>` (for example `ButtonLink` / `ButtonAnchor`), or call `buttonVariants()` only in a Client Component.

```tsx
import Link from "next/link"
import { buttonVariants } from "@nowly/ui"
import { cn } from "@nowly/ui"

// Client Component only:
<Link href="/library" className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant: "ghost", size: "lg" }))}>
  Library
</Link>
```

Use `<Button>` only for true actions (`type="button"` / `submit`) that do not change the URL.
