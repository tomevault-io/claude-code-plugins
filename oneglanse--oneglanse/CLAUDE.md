# Engineering rules

OneGlanse is an open-source AI visibility tracker. Provider collection uses browser automation against real product interfaces; analysis is a separate model-backed step.

Code and tests define implemented behavior.

## Public writing

- Explain OneGlanse with concrete nouns and verbs. Use "answer," "website," "browser," "server," and "model you connect" when those name the thing more clearly than an abstract term.
- Keep technical names when they matter. Setup and reference docs must stay precise and instructional.
- Narrative pages may use first person because one developer maintains OneGlanse.
- Put detailed limits on `/methodology`. Link to that page instead of repeating the same caveat across the site.
- Read new public copy aloud. Rewrite sentences that sound unnatural in conversation.

## Navigate and change code

- Use CodeGraph first for current structure, ownership, callers, and call paths. Use `rg` for exact text and references. If `.codegraph/` is absent, run `pnpm codegraph:init`.
- Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` only when a change crosses system boundaries or requires architectural context.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` is for contributor setup and workflow.
- For behavior changes, read the implementation, direct callers and consumers, and relevant tests before editing.
- Make the smallest coherent change. Preserve unrelated work and behavior.
- Keep one authoritative owner for each rule. Do not add an abstraction, option, or fallback for a hypothetical need.

## Change decomposition

Before creating a branch or editing files for a nontrivial task, decide whether the work belongs in one pull request or should be split into stages.

Split the work when it crosses more than one responsibility, pipeline boundary, independent invariant, or substantial runtime surface:

1. Define the stages before implementation.
2. Give each stage one responsibility and one primary review question.
3. Keep implementation, tests, and required documentation for that responsibility in the same stage.
4. Use stacked pull requests when a later stage depends on an earlier one.
5. Target `main` from the first independently mergeable stage. A dependent stage targets its parent stage branch.

If the work has one coherent responsibility, keep it in one pull request. Do not split merely because many files or implementation steps are involved.

## Git and pull requests

- Branch from the latest appropriate base before implementation.
- Use descriptive prefixes such as `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `perf/`, `test/`, `docs/`, `ci/`, `build/`, and `chore/`.
- Keep each pull request to one coherent responsibility and one primary review question.
- Split when a new responsibility, pipeline boundary, independent invariant, or substantial runtime surface begins. File count alone is not a reason to split.
- Use stacked pull requests for dependent stages rather than accumulating later stages into one branch.
- Do not combine unrelated cleanup with the requested change.
- Do not push directly to `main`.
- Merge only after the required PR Gate passes.

## Protect the boundaries

- Keep reusable application behavior in `packages/services`. Web routes and components own the HTTP and UI boundary.
- Keep provider-specific browser behavior with its provider. Share it only when multiple current providers need the same behavior.
- PostgreSQL owns accounts, workspaces, and relational configuration. ClickHouse owns configured prompts, captured responses, and analysis data. Redis/BullMQ owns provider jobs and run coordination.
- Run provider browser automation in Agent, outside the Web request lifecycle.
- Preserve both `local` and `self-host` modes and their different auth, proxy, and scheduling behavior.
- Keep deterministic CI independent of live provider UIs, provider credentials, and paid model calls.

## Verify behavior

- Test behavior, not source-text edits. Add a regression test for a bug when practical.
- Test provider DOM and extraction changes with sanitized, deterministic fixtures. Use a live provider check only when the external UI boundary itself needs verification.
- Test Docker packaging through the built image and its runtime checks. Measure the affected path before and after a performance claim.
- Do not run checks locally when the PR workflow already covers them. Do not manually dispatch or rerun a workflow for a commit that already has its check result. Inspect the existing GitHub status instead.
- Run a local check only when the PR workflow does not cover the behavior or when it helps diagnose a failure. A new commit receives its own automatic PR workflow run. GitHub's PR Gate is the merge check; the native image matrix runs in CI when relevant.
