# Desktop (Tauri v2)

Check `desktop/Cargo.toml`, `desktop/capabilities/**`, and `desktop/tauri.conf.json` before adding desktop capabilities. Release versions are also set in `desktop/tauri.conf.json` and `desktop/Cargo.toml` (`tools/AGENTS.md`, Releases).

- File system and shell permissions must be configured explicitly; a vague "Internal error" save failure usually means a missing permission.
- Dev tools: add or use a menu item to toggle them; do not rely on keyboard shortcuts.
- `desktop/src/credentials.rs` stores secrets in the native system credential store; failures must surface, never fall back to browser or plaintext storage (`src/AGENTS.md`, Settings).
- ACP and harness process changes require checking `desktop/capabilities/**`.
- A `shell:allow-spawn` entry pins the whole command line: no `"args": true`, and a Windows `.cmd` shim runs through its own `cmd-<name>` entry with fixed `/c <name> …` arguments, which `resolvePlatformCommand` selects (`tests/engine/tauri/command.test.ts`).
- `desktop/generated/menu.json` is produced by `bun run generate:tauri-menu` from `src/app/shell/menu/schema.ts`; do not edit or import it directly.
- Run `bun run generate:icons --target desktop` before direct Cargo checks; native icons are generated, not committed.
- `build_fig_file` performs `.fig` export on desktop; the browser path uses fflate (`packages/fig/AGENTS.md`).
- The embedded WebDriver plugin compiles only with the `native-test` Cargo feature and must never be enabled in development or production binaries. Native tests use `bun run test:native` (`tests/AGENTS.md`).
- `openpencil://` links are parsed in `desktop/src/deep_link.rs`: `open` queues files through `take_pending_open`, `join` queues validated room IDs through `take_pending_rooms`; second launches forward their link arguments through the single-instance handler (`deep_link` unit tests).
