## What this repo is (one line)

Coven is a small, boring **Rust authority layer** with TypeScript integration
packages around it. The development loop must keep that boundary clear: core
logic stays in Rust; the npm packages are thin integration surface.

## Check, enter a worktree, then claim it

Multiple agent sessions (Codex, Claude Code, familiars) frequently run against
**the same checkout at once**, each in its own worktree. Worktrees keep git
operations from racing, but they do **not** stop two sessions from independently
building the *same issue* — which has happened repeatedly, producing duplicate
PRs that a session then has to close. Before you touch code:

1. **Check what's already taken.** Duplication hides behind divergent branch
   names — one issue once spawned `fix/output-polish`, `fix/311-output-polish`,
   *and* `fix/output-polish-311` — so branch names alone won't tell you. Check
   both the shared claim registry and open PRs:
   ```sh
   coven claim status          # active claims, shared across every worktree of this repo
   gh pr list --state open     # is there already a PR for this issue?
   ```
   If the issue is claimed or already has a PR, pick different work or coordinate.

2. **Create or enter the task worktree.** The automatic fallback identity is
   worktree-scoped, so enter the worktree before acquiring the claim:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin main
   git worktree add -b <branch> /tmp/coven-<branch-slug> origin/main
   cd /tmp/coven-<branch-slug>
   ```

3. **Claim it with a shared, issue-keyed token** — not your working branch name,
   which no other session can predict:
   ```sh
   coven claim acquire issue-<N>     # e.g. issue-311; a TTL-bounded lock
   ```
   Claims live in the repo's shared `--git-common-dir/agent-claims/`, so every
   worktree and session sees them. For long tasks, extend the TTL with
   `coven claim heartbeat issue-<N>`.

4. **Release from the same worktree when your PR merges or you stop:**
   `coven claim release issue-<N>`.

This step is cheap and it is the single thing that prevents duplicate-PR churn.
Without an explicit `COVEN_AGENT_ID`, Coven identifies the owner as
`$USER@<worktree-slug>`. Set distinct explicit IDs only when multiple agents
must share one worktree.

## Durable work tracking

GitHub issues in the owning repository are the sole work tracker. Record
assignees, priority, acceptance criteria, blockers/sub-issues, and exact delivery
evidence there. Follow [`docs/work-tracking.md`](docs/work-tracking.md).
Repository coordination still uses issue-keyed Coven claims and task worktrees.
Do not initialize a separate local tracking database or sync branch.

## Branch & PR workflow (all agents)

- **Coordinate before editing** (see above) — check `coven claim status` and
  `gh pr list`, enter a fresh worktree, then acquire `issue-<N>` from inside it.
- **Never push to `main`.** Every change lands via a PR with green CI. Branch
  from current `origin/main`.
- **Fresh branch per task.** If multiple sessions may touch this repo, use the
  task worktree created before claim acquisition so operations don't race.
- Keep the diff **scoped to one concern**; no drive-by refactors in a feature PR.
- Conventional-commit subjects: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`.
- For larger changes, **start from an issue** and include the readiness packet
  the PR template asks for.
- After merge: delete the remote branch, remove your local worktree/branch.

## CI gates — run locally before opening the PR

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) rejects on any of these. Run them first:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked
python scripts/check-secrets.py        # secret scan — must be clean
python3 scripts/check-coven-privacy.py --staged   # privacy guard on your staged changes
```

If you touched the **npm/TypeScript** packages, also:

```sh
npm run build
npm test
```

`-D warnings` has **no exceptions**. Fix lints; don't `#[allow(...)]` without a
justifying comment.

### The `Policy guard` job

The five commands above are **not** the whole gate. `cargo test` does not run
any of the repo's guard scripts, so a branch can be green locally and still fail
the required `PR gate` on `Policy guard` — a ~24-step job whose failures show up
only after you push. Two of its steps have bitten recent PRs: the documentation
ownership guard (#1089) and the CI workflow guard (#1118).

Reproduce the whole job before pushing. The subshell keeps a failing guard from
closing your terminal, and still reports a non-zero status, so a printed
`FAILED:` line cannot be lost in the scroll:

```sh
(
  fail=0
  for s in check-coven-privacy-test.py check-secrets-test.py \
           check-api-contract-docs-test.py check-api-contract-docs.py \
           check-docs-ownership-test.py check-security-policy-test.py \
           check-security-policy.py check-theme-tokens-test.py \
           check-theme-tokens.py check-secrets.py \
           classify-ci-changes-test.py check-reliability-scorecard-test.py \
           check-reliability-scorecard.py check-workflows-test.py \
           check-ci-workflow-test.py install-native-link-dependencies-test.py; do
    python3 "scripts/$s" || { echo "FAILED: $s"; fail=1; }
  done

  node --test scripts/package-github-release-test.mjs || fail=1
  node --test scripts/package-automations-protocol.test.mjs scripts/script-entrypoint.test.mjs || fail=1
  node --test scripts/package-automations-authority-profile.test.mjs || fail=1
  node --test conformance/automations/runner/conformance.test.mjs conformance/automations/runner/audit.test.mjs || fail=1
  node --test scripts/release-stress-test.mjs || fail=1
  node --test scripts/benchmark-cli.test.mjs scripts/benchmark-chaos.test.mjs || fail=1
  bash scripts/check-workflows.sh || fail=1

  exit "$fail"
)
echo "Policy guard (local): $?"
```

A trailing `Policy guard (local): 0` is the pass signal. Do not read a clean
tail of the output as success — several of these guards print nothing when they
pass, and the earlier failure may be thousands of lines up.

### Two guards that only inspect what your branch changed

These take a revision range, and CI passes the PR's base...head. Run them the
same way — `--staged` is not equivalent, because it misses anything you have
already committed:

```sh
python3 scripts/check-docs-ownership.py --range "origin/main...HEAD"
python3 scripts/check-coven-privacy.py  --range "origin/main...HEAD"
```

Because they are range-scoped, **a file that is already non-compliant on `main`
fails only once your branch touches it.** A one-line edit to a long-untouched
page can surface a problem you did not introduce. That is the guard working as
designed: fix the file (for docs ownership, usually by adding a
`source_adjacent_reason` to its frontmatter), rather than reverting your edit.

### Changing `.github/workflows/` needs more than CI green

Two things do not show up in a local `cargo test`:

- **Other workflows run `cargo test --workspace` too.** `release-npm.yml` gates
  the published release on it, and `release-stress.yml` compiles with it. A
  change to which targets that command builds — adding `required-features` to a
  `[[test]]`, say — silently changes the **release** gate as well as CI. Check
  every hit of `grep -rn 'cargo test --workspace' .github/workflows/` before
  assuming CI is the only consumer.
- **Pushing a workflow file needs the `workflow` OAuth scope.** An otherwise
  valid `git push` over HTTPS is rejected with *"refusing to allow an OAuth App
  to create or update workflow"*. Either `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s
  workflow`, or push that branch over SSH.

## Repo-specific invariants (don't break these)

- **Keep the Rust authority boundary clean.** Business/authority logic lives in
  the Rust crates. Don't push core decisions into the TS packages.
- **Supported harness set is Codex, Claude Code, and GitHub Copilot CLI** until
  policy and adapter contracts are stable. Don't add speculative harness adapters.
- **Never weaken the secret scan.** If `check-secrets.py` flags something, fix
  the content — don't allowlist your way past it.
- **Wall-clock assertions in tests must clear scheduler jitter.** A bound like
  `assert!(started.elapsed() < …)` runs on shared CI runners, so a threshold
  close to the nominal duration will flake. Before adding or "fixing" one, work
  out which kind it is — they are not interchangeable, and a blanket bump
  deletes real coverage:
  - **A documented contract** (e.g. the two-second `daemon stop` budget in
    `daemon.rs`): keep it strict. This is the assertion's whole point.
  - **A discriminating threshold** separating a fast path from an injected slow
    path: put the bound near the *midpoint*, not just above the fast path.
  - **A hang guard** that only turns a wedge into a readable failure: set it far
    above anything load can produce, and say so in a comment.
  - **A promptness claim already proven deterministically** in the same test
    (a call count, an ordering, an error string): delete it rather than tune it.

  Report the observed duration in the failure message, or the next flake tells
  you nothing.
- **Short budgets passed into code under test also select races.** Audit
  `recv_timeout(...)` and timeout arguments as well as `elapsed()` assertions.
  For test sequencing, wait for an explicit readiness/completion event, and
  announce early failure so the wait cannot silently wedge. For negative
  channel assertions, join the producer before checking the final sequence.
  Keep genuine timeout tests: make the slow path explicit (for example a
  reader that always returns `WouldBlock`), and assert its failure class.
  If asynchronous cleanup can validly choose multiple errors, retain the
  status and containment assertions and exercise each permitted branch
  deterministically. Do not widen production deadlines or all test budgets.
- Prefer the fast loop (`cargo check`, debug builds) over `--release` unless you
  specifically need optimized output.

## Attribution — credit contributors correctly

When you re-land or build on someone else's work (a fork PR, an issue author's
proposal, a co-author), **credit the human contributor with a working
GitHub-linked trailer** so they appear in the contributors graph and on their
profile:

```
Co-authored-by: Full Name <ID+username@users.noreply.github.com>
```

- Use the **numeric-id no-reply form**. Get the id with
  `gh api users/<login> --jq .id`.
- **Never** use a machine/`.local` email (e.g. `name@Someones-Mac.local`) in a
  co-author trailer — it links to no account and gives **zero** credit.
- When a squash-merge collapses a contributor's PR into an internal branch,
  preserve their `Co-authored-by:` line in the squash commit message.

## Secrets & safety

- Never commit secrets, tokens, or private emails. Use `*.noreply.github.com`
  for attribution.
- Don't disable CI gates or branch protection to land a change. If it can't go
  through a green PR, surface the blocker instead of working around it.
