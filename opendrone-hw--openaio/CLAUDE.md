# OpenAIO

All-in-one board for toothpick-class FPV, 2-6S: 4x AM32 ESC, power, pads and
ExpressLRS 2.4 GHz receiver on 25.5 x 25.5 mm, with the flight controller
(MCU, IMU, baro, OSD, blackbox) on the shared OpenFC-Core module, reflowed onto
this board as a 52 pad LGA (J1). The ESC and RX sheets come from OpenESC-20x20
and OpenRX-Lite, the pads from OpenFC-Lite-Mini, wired on the root sheet.

## Architecture

One board. The flight controller is not designed here: it is the OpenFC-Core
module, placed as J1 (`lib:OpenDrone-Core`, footprint
`OpenDrone-Core_LGA_land`, 52 pads of 1.0 mm on a 2.0 mm grid, 15 x 15 mm)
and reflowed onto the top side like any other part. Everything the core needs
from this board crosses that land: `+4v5` and `+BATT` in, `MOTOR1..4` out to
the four `esc_channel` sheets, `UART0`/`UART1` and `PIOUART0`/`PIOUART1` to
the RX sheet and the pads, `CURR` from the current sense amplifier,
`10V_ENABLE` to the power sheet, `BUZZER-`, `LED_STRIP`, `VIDEO_IN`/`OUT`,
USB `D+`/`D-` to the Type-C. Pad names are the core's net names; the pin map
and land are defined by the core's vendored symbol and footprint. They are not
edited in this repo.

## Voltage envelope

2S-6S, 6.0 to 25.2 V. The ceiling is the MOSFET: DOY180N03T is 30 V VDSS, the
same part and the same NSG2065Q topology OpenESC-20x20 flies at 6S. The 40 V
SP40N01GHNK that takes OpenESC-30x30 to 8S is PDFN-8L 5x6 and four channels of
it do not fit on 25.5 mm, so 6S is the ceiling here, not 8S.

At the bottom of the range the +10V gate rail is not regulated: the buck runs
in pass-through and the drivers see roughly +BATT, which at 2S is about 5.9 V,
above the NSG2065Q 4.5 V UVLO and inside its 5-20 V supply range. The board
runs, but gate drive is about half, so the continuous-current rating at 2S is
lower than at 6S; neither figure is published without a measurement.

## Layout rules

- Nothing may stand under J1 on the top side: the core's bottom is flat
  copper on the land. Bottom side parts under it are fine.
- J1 keeps every pad, unused ones stay open; delete pads per instance only for
  routing room. Ground pads tie into the plane.
- Move the core only by moving J1; never edit the footprint here.

## Environment

```sh
# schematic and board checks
kicad-cli sch erc hardware/OpenAIO.kicad_sch
kicad-cli pcb drc --schematic-parity --refill-zones hardware/OpenAIO.kicad_pcb

# netlist, for scripted analysis
kicad-cli sch export netlist --format kicadsexpr -o /tmp/OpenAIO.net hardware/OpenAIO.kicad_sch
```

On macOS `kicad-cli` is at
`/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/MacOS/kicad-cli`, and `pcbnew` imports
only under KiCad's bundled Python. Reusable scripts for renders, STEP export,
and packaging art come from Incutec hardware tooling. The OpenDrone release
standard is
[RELEASES.md](https://github.com/OpenDrone-hw/.github/blob/main/RELEASES.md).
Board-specific scripts, where a board has any, live in `hardware/tools/`.
`KPY` is KiCad's bundled Python, on macOS
`/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3`.

## Rules

Identical in every OpenDrone board repo. Do not edit here; edit the template.

- **Never text-edit** `.kicad_sch`, `.kicad_pcb` or `.kicad_dru`. Use KiCad, or
  kicad-skip / the pcbnew API for scripted changes. `.kicad_pro` is JSON and may
  be edited directly for metadata.
- **Metadata yes, connections no.** An agent may write BOM and documentation
  fields (MPN, Manufacturer, LCSC, Cost, Datasheet, text variables). An agent
  may not change nets, wiring, routing, placement, footprint assignment, or any
  value that changes the circuit.
- **Close KiCad before any write to a KiCad file.** KiCad caches library tables
  at process start and overwrites files on save.
- **Reuse before you draw.** Check the `OpenDrone` library and its
  `PARTS-USED.md` first. If the part is there we have already sourced,
  footprinted and shipped it, and its symbol links to the exact committed
  datasheet: place it from `OpenDrone`. Draw a new part into `lib` only when
  the catalogue has nothing that fits, imported with
  `easyeda2kicad` from its LCSC number. Pulling a newer catalogue is a
  deliberate, reviewed commit: `git submodule update --remote
  hardware/KiCad-Library`, then DRC.
- **One person holds a board layout at a time.** KiCad files do not merge. Say
  on Discord that you are taking it. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Run ERC and DRC before every pull request.** Existing approved findings
  may remain; a new type or increased count must be reviewed before merge.
  Commands are in Environment above.

## By task

Board-specific paths are in Environment above. `KPY` is KiCad's bundled
Python named there.

- Check the design: run the ERC and DRC commands in Environment before every pull request.
- Add a part: place it from the `OpenDrone` library if `hardware/KiCad-Library/PARTS-USED.md` lists it; otherwise import it into `lib` with `$KPY <hardware-tooling>/hardware/kicad/import_part.py` (read `--help` first), KiCad closed.
- Render the board for the README: `$KPY <hardware-tooling>/hardware/kicad/render_board.py hardware/OpenAIO.kicad_pcb --outdir images`, KiCad closed.
- Analyse the netlist: export it with the netlist command in Environment, then read it with a script; never hand-write a second BOM.
- Update the shared library: `git submodule update --remote hardware/KiCad-Library`, run DRC, commit as its own reviewed change.
