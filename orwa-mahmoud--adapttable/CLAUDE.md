# AdaptTable — agent and contributor guide

Working rules for this repository. They apply to AI agents and human
contributors alike; PRs are reviewed against them.

## Architecture: core is headless

`@adapttable/core` owns the engine — state, the filter model, operators, URL
serialization, chips, mutations, registries, and the state machines behind
every interaction. The framework bindings adapt them into hooks (`@adapttable/react`) or signals
(`@adapttable/angular`) and render structure. Adapters own the look. Switching the kit in
the live demo must change how the whole table looks, including the Filters
popover and drawer: an MUI table filters with MUI controls, a Mantine table
with Mantine controls.

Unify the **model**, never the **pixels**. The standing pattern is
**Chrome + slots**:

- The binding ships `*Chrome` components that own structure only — layout,
  the recursion over groups, keyboard wiring, localized labels, and the
  `data-adapttable-part` names — driven by the models and state machines in
  core.
- Every visible control (input, select, checkbox, button — anything the end
  user clicks) is a **required slot** the adapter fills with its own kit's
  component. Slots have no native fallback in core or the binding: a kit
  cannot silently render raw HTML. `adapter-unstyled` supplies native
  controls because native IS its kit; shadcn/tailwind build on unstyled.
- Do not add user-facing controls to core or the binding, and do not give a
  slot a default implementation. Invisible chrome (live regions, announcers,
  layout structure) is fine there.
- Feature parity means every kit has the feature **with its own components**.
  A shared look is not parity — copying one adapter's raw-HTML control into
  another adapter is the same defect as drawing it in core.
- If a kit's overlay or portal misbehaves inside the filter popover, fix it
  in that adapter (`disablePortal`, `getPopupContainer`, or that kit's native
  select) — never by weakening the slot contract.
- `data-adapttable-part` names and placement are part of the public contract:
  the same part lands on the same element in every adapter, and documented
  `classNames` keys are honored by every adapter that renders the part.
- A kit talks only to its binding: a React kit imports only
  `@adapttable/react/…`, a Vue or Angular kit only its own binding. Only a
  binding imports `@adapttable/core`, and it re-exports what its kits need.
  When a kit needs a core name its binding lacks, add the re-export to the
  binding — never import core from the kit. Core's deprecation notes point to
  core (`@adapttable/core/binding`), never to a framework package. ESLint
  enforces this on kit sources.

## Framework packages

- `packages/react/react` is the React binding; its eight supported kits live
  under `packages/react/adapter-*`.
- `packages/angular/angular` is the Angular binding, with signal controllers,
  templates, component renderers and structural Chrome.
- `@adapttable/angular-unstyled` (`packages/angular/adapter-angular-unstyled`)
  and `@adapttable/ng-zorro` (`packages/angular/adapter-ng-zorro`) provide
  native HTML and NG-ZORRO controls through that binding.
- `packages/angular/ai-angular` adds optional agent, assistant and speech
  bindings over neutral `@adapttable/ai`.
- `@adapttable/angular-unstyled`, `@adapttable/ng-zorro` and
  `@adapttable/ai-angular` are prepared for their first public `0.1.0` release.
  npm publication is a separate owner-controlled step; publishable manifests
  and implemented support do not imply registry availability.

## Product decisions — settled, do not reopen

- Core is headless; adapters own appearance. Chrome + slots (above) is the
  settled widget architecture — do not reopen core-drawn controls or per-kit
  copies of the layout.
- Junior-friendly, senior-targeted: easy defaults for everyone, full control
  for experts — never trade one for the other.
- One word per concept: `server` is the remote-tier word, `useQuerySource`
  the query-library hook. No synonyms, no parallel callbacks, no
  config-object API.
- The showcase is the only demo app. Competitor comparisons stay factual and
  dated.
- Everything is opt-in: omitting a prop renders nothing and costs nothing.
- The table never owns the data. Every write — edits, adds, deletes,
  reorders — is a callback to the host; the table asks, the host does.
- `packages/react/adapter-bootstrap` is private and unfinished. It is not
  published, and its `private` role in the kit registry (`scripts/kits.mjs`)
  keeps it out of the kit contracts — the parts-parity check, the
  conformance suite and feature parity. Its gaps are known: do not raise
  them as findings, add it to those contracts or bring it to parity unless a
  task names it.

## Process

- Branch off `main` for every change (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, `chore/…`); merge
  via PR. Never commit directly to `main`.
- One concern per commit. A commit that belongs to an issue names it with
  `Refs #N` in its body; the pull request body carries one `Closes #N` line per
  issue it completes, so the closing list is reviewed — and corrected if
  needed — before merge. A bare `(#N)` in a subject links but never closes. An
  issue closes when the PR that lists it merges: work that is only committed
  locally leaves its issue open, and closing one by hand is never the way it
  happens.
- Screenshots and scratch artifacts are temporary: keep them in
  `.playwright-mcp/` or `/tmp`, never the repo root, and delete them when
  done.

## The quality gate — green before every push, zero suppressions

`pnpm check` is the full local library gate. Husky runs `format:check` on
every commit (fast). Pre-push runs `pnpm check:if-needed` then
`pnpm e2e:if-needed`, using the same path classify as the PR Detect job:
docs, workflows, and README skip lint, types, coverage and build; a package
change still runs the full sequence:

```
format:check → lint → lint:root → check:readmes → check:docsurface
→ check:parts → typecheck → test:coverage → test:scripts → build
→ publint → smoke:dist → budget → test:e2e
```

- **Coverage floors are enforced per package** — do not lower a threshold to
  get green; raise real coverage or raise the design question.
- **Zero ignore comments.** No `eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`,
  `@ts-expect-error`, `prettier-ignore`, or coverage excludes to dodge a
  rule. Fix the root cause; if a rule seems genuinely wrong, raise it.
- Never weaken tests or assertions to pass. If a test fails, the code or the
  test is wrong — find out which.
- **`pnpm test:e2e` is part of the bar** — `pnpm check` does not run it.
  Pre-push runs `pnpm e2e:if-needed`: skip when the diff vs `origin/main` has
  no browser-relevant package, showcase, docs or E2E changes; run only changed
  E2E specs when that is all that changed; otherwise the full suite. Shared,
  React and Angular package edits and docs-only edits run Playwright. The PR
  workflow uses the same path set; README/metadata-only edits still skip it.
  Needs Chromium once: `pnpm exec playwright install chromium`.
- A change is not done until the gate is green with real command output —
  evidence, not assertions. Anything visual or keyboard-driven is also
  verified in a real browser.

### Feature definition of done

All adapters at parity · mobile card layout handled (or the behavior stated
explicitly) · RTL correct · keyboard accessible with screen-reader
announcements where the feature speaks · new labels localized in every
locale in `packages/shared/i18n` · state serializes to URL / Saved Views where the
feature is stateful · docs page + `llms.txt` registration + showcase
coverage where visual · tests with the coverage floors met.

## Changesets and version bumps

**The bump follows the change, per SemVer.** Pick it from what the change does,
not from habit:

1. Check real versions first — `packages/*/*/package.json` **and**
   `npm view <pkg> version`. Never guess from memory or chat.
2. Docs, demo media, changelog-only, bug fixes, UI corrections, internal
   refactors → `patch`. New user-facing feature or new public export →
   `minor`; that is what SemVer means and labelling one `patch` hides it from
   everyone reading the changelog. Breaking API → `major`, **only with the
   maintainer's approval** — never a default, never inferred from the work
   being finished.
3. A replaced path is deprecated in place and keeps working. Deprecations are
   not removed piecemeal: they stay until the maintainer decides to ship a
   major, and that release removes every deprecated path at once and carries
   the breaking changes parked for it. Until then, `@deprecated` plus a note
   naming the replacement is the whole of the change.
4. Versioning is independent per package — never tell users to match
   versions; exact pins resolve core automatically.

Release mechanics: merge the PR carrying its changeset → the bot opens a
"Version Packages" PR → merging that publishes to npm. A main push with
neither a pending changeset nor an unpublished version skips the Release
job; publish is build → publint → `changeset publish`, not `verify:release`.

## Generated vs hand-written files

Committed but **generated — never hand-edit**:

- `llms-full.txt` — built by `pnpm llms` from `docs/*.md` in the `DOCS`
  array order of `scripts/build-llms-full.mjs`. Edit docs → `pnpm format` →
  regenerate → commit, in that order.
- `apps/showcase/<adapter>/**/index.html` and the redirect stubs beside them —
  written by `node scripts/build-showcase-html.mjs` from
  `apps/showcase/matrix.mjs`. Edit the matrix → regenerate → commit;
  `scripts/showcase-html.test.mjs` fails the gate when they disagree.
- `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` — written by changesets only.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

Generated at build time and gitignored: `apps/docs/src/content/docs/` and
`apps/docs/public/llms*.txt` (from `sync-docs.mjs` — the canonical markdown
is root `docs/`; always edit there), plus `dist/`, `coverage/`, `.astro/`,
`.turbo/`.

Hand-written: root `docs/*.md`, `llms.txt` (the llmstxt.org index), README.

A new docs page needs **two registrations** or it silently misses the LLM
surface: the `DOCS` array in `scripts/build-llms-full.mjs` AND a link in
`llms.txt`.

## Showcase rules

- Each adapter demo renders only its own kit's components — mount the real
  `@adapttable/*` adapters, never cross-import kits, never mock the table.
- A demo page is registered **once**, in `apps/showcase/pages.mjs`: Vite's
  build inputs and the sitemap's `/demo/` URLs are both generated from that
  manifest, and `pnpm check:sitemap` verifies the composed site against it in
  the docs workflow. A page that must ship without being indexed — a redirect
  stub — sets `indexable: false`.
- The demo is **adapter-first**: each adapter has a landing page
  (`/demo/mantine/`) and one page per feature (`/demo/mantine/pivot/`), so a
  reader searching for a Mantine pivot table lands on one. Those pages are not
  written by hand — the adapters, the features and every word on the pages live
  in `apps/showcase/matrix.mjs`, which `pages.mjs` expands into the manifest,
  `scripts/build-showcase-html.mjs` writes the static HTML from, and
  `src/matrix/MatrixPage.tsx` renders. Add a feature there and it appears in the
  build, the sitemap, the nav and the served HTML at once.
- Column groups, RTL, realtime, rows, nested tables and accessibility are
  matrix features — one page per kit, same as filtering. Pagination is not a
  demo destination; the docs page owns that search. `/demo/rtl/` is a redirect
  stub to `/demo/mantine/rtl/`.
- Overlay contracts:
  - `filtersMode="popover"` (default) is a lightweight anchored card with
    **no backdrop**. It anchors under its trigger (flipping for RTL), closes
    on Escape and outside click, restores focus on Escape, sets
    `aria-expanded` on the trigger, and sits above sticky headers and pinned
    cells with zero bleed-through.
  - `filtersMode="drawer"` keeps a real backdrop that dims and blocks the
    background — each kit's native Drawer provides it.
  - Prefer each kit's native overlay primitive so portaling, z-index and
    focus handling come for free.
- Demo media in `apps/docs/public/media/` stays — including files nothing
  currently references; they are source material for re-cuts and re-uploads.
  The only defect is identical bytes under two names, which get consolidated.
