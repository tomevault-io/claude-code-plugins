FasterNGIO generates Skyrim SE grass caches in NGIO's `.cgid` format, with NGIO-style "no grass in
objects" rejection ray traced on the GPU (D3D12 or Vulkan) or, as a fallback, against a CPU BVH. It is
a standalone, GPL-3 command-line tool for Windows and Linux: it must not depend on SARP, BasicRenderer
or CommonLibSSE.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/GameData/` | Plugin (ESM/ESP/ESL) reading, in the order data flows: `LoadOrder` (plugins.txt, TES4 headers, FileIDs), `PluginParser` (one plugin's records into a `StaticPluginShard`), `StaticWorld` (overrides resolved into the `StaticWorldSnapshot`). `FormID.h` and `Records.h` hold the types, `Internal/` the file format (`RecordReader`) and the per-record extractors. Only the fields placement and rejection use are read. |
| `src/Grass/` | Grass placement: `Placement.h` (settings, candidates, `GenerateCellCandidates`), `VanillaPlacement.cpp` (the engine's algorithm), `SmoothPlacement` (`SmoothWeightField` and smooth placement), `Internal/PlacementCommon.h` (terrain sampling, filters and blade encoding both share). `CellCache` turns placed blades into a cell's `.cgid` (`FinalizeCell`: the engine's blocks and quadrant cap; file names); `GrassModels` measures each GRAS model's blades per block; `NgioCacheWriter` is the format; `GameIni` the game's `[Grass]` INI settings; `LandTexture` which land textures the terrain shows where (NGIO's texture forms). |
| `src/Archives/` | Memory-mapped BSA (v103/104/105) reader and load-order-aware resolver (loose files win). |
| `src/Platform/` | `DataDirectory`: case-insensitive, either-separator resolution of Data paths (an index off Windows); `IniFile`; `GameInstall` (validates a game folder, detects the store build, derives plugins.txt and the INI folder); `ModOrganizer` (the MO2 instance and profile this process runs under); `UserSettings` (the launcher's remembered choices); the small shared helpers: `FileSystem` (per-user folders), `Text` (UTF-8 paths, ASCII case folding), `MappedFile`, `WholeFile`. |
| `src/Collision/` | nifly-based Havok collision extraction (CMS, packed strips, convex hulls, boxes, spheres, capsules) into model space; on request, the render shapes' names and vertices (`NearestRenderShape`, for NGIO's shape-name filters), or (experimental `renderGeometry`) the visible render triangles in place of a model's collision. `InstanceShape`: the triangle and vertex counts of the shape the engine instances grass from. |
| `src/Rejection/` | NGIO query shapes (`RejectionConfig`), the per-world instance index (`WorldIndex`), the CPU BVH fallback (`CpuBvh`), the brute-force reference (`CpuReference`), and `Bounds` (AABBs and primitive kinds, shared with the GPU). `RejectionFeatures` holds NGIO's resolved lists and objects; `NgioRules` the per-blade decision (ignored shapes, grass cliffs) that every backend feeds. |
| `src/Seasons/` | Seasons of Skyrim's swap types and the automatic winter swaps (`SeasonSwaps`). |
| `src/Gpu/` | `GpuRejector`: feature check, the render thread (OpenRenderGraph `PersistentGraphHost`), BLAS/TLAS, ray-tracing pipeline, one DispatchRays per frame, readback. `ModelPacking` lays collision out for the shader (in Core, so it is testable without a GPU); `GpuShaders` loads the shader library. |
| `src/Pipeline/` | Lock-free cell pipeline on ORGModuleServices' AsyncStateGraph (`CellPipeline`), the writer threads (`FileWriterPool`), the waiters that suspend in the graph (`SuspensionWaiters`), the TBB graph scheduler. |
| `src/Concurrency/` | Header-only lock-free building blocks: `MpscQueue`, `WaitUntil`. |
| `apps/FasterNGIO/` | The `FasterNGIOApp` library: `CommandLine` (arguments, MO2 defaults), `Options` (`GenerateOptions` and the names of its choices), `Generate` (the run itself: snapshot, per-world loop, progress and cancellation), `WorldSetup` (preparing a world), `Diagnostics`, `NgioConfig` (NGIO's `GrassControl.ini` and `*_NGIO.ini`), `SeasonsConfig` (Seasons of Skyrim's settings, swap files and per-world passes). The executable adds `Main.cpp` (CLI or launcher) and `Gui/` (the ImGui launcher; Win32 + D3D11 on Windows, GLFW + OpenGL 3 elsewhere). |
| `shaders/` | `GrassRejection.hlsl` (DXIL for D3D12, SPIR-V for Vulkan), `Shared/GrassQueryMath.hlsli` (the overlap tests and segment hits) and `Shared/RejectionLayout.hlsli` (the buffer and root-constant layouts), which the C++ also compiles (`src/Rejection/HlslShim.h`). |
| `tests/` | One file per module; `TestSupport.h` has the temp-folder and file helpers. `GameDataTests` writes tiny plugins and archives; `RejectionTests` builds synthetic worlds. |
| `tools/` | `build_linux.sh` and `setup_linux.sh` (sharing `linux_common.sh`); `analyze_placement_edges.py`: grid-locking and corner statistics of `--export-blades` output, with a grid-free control. |
| `external/` | Submodules: BasicRHI, OpenRenderGraph, ORGModuleServices, BasicTelemetry, volk (pinned to BasicRenderer's commits) and upstream nifly. |

## Build and test

```powershell
cmake --preset vs2026          # GPU build (D3D12 + Vulkan); vs2026-cpu builds without the GPU stack
cmake --build --preset vs2026
ctest --preset vs2026
```

```sh
cmake --preset linux -DVulkan_INCLUDE_DIR=<Vulkan-Headers>/include   # or linux-cpu
cmake --build --preset linux && ctest --preset linux
```

`build.cmd [all|windows|linux] [gpu|cpu] [test]` builds the `vs2026` preset and then, under WSL
(`FASTERNGIO_WSL_DISTRO`, default Ubuntu), runs `tools/build_linux.sh`, which also builds natively. It
takes `VCPKG_ROOT`, `VULKAN_HEADERS_DIR`, `FASTERNGIO_DXC_EXECUTABLE` and `FASTERNGIO_BUILD_DIR` from
the environment or from an untracked `build-linux.env` in the repository root; keep machine paths there.
What is missing comes from `tools/setup_linux.sh`: the compiler, cmake and ninja through apt (build.cmd
runs that step as root in WSL), and vcpkg and Vulkan-Headers in `~/.local/share/fasterngio` when the
variables are unset. Under WSL with the repository on a Windows drive the build directory defaults to
`~/.cache/fasterngio/build`, since the Linux filesystem builds several times faster.

Both scripts then package the release folders `release/FasterNGIO-windows[-cpu]` and
`release/FasterNGIO-linux[-cpu]` (stripped) with `cmake --install --component FasterNGIO`. Anything
the executable needs at runtime must be installed into that component.

vcpkg (`VCPKG_ROOT`) provides zlib, lz4, TBB, spdlog, fmt, gtest, Tracy and, for the GPU build,
directx-headers, directx-dxc, flecs, boost-container-hash, nlohmann-json, sqlite3 and (off Windows)
directxmath. Vulkan headers must include `VK_EXT_descriptor_heap` (Vulkan SDK 1.4.357 or the matching
Vulkan-Headers tag); distribution headers are usually too old. Off Windows, DirectX-Headers'
`wsl/winadapter.h` supplies the Win32 scalar types the shared libraries use. `vs2026-clangcl` builds
with `-Werror`; GCC and Clang get `-Wall -Wextra`, and `-Werror` with `FASTERNGIO_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS`.

Shaders are deployed next to the exe by the `FasterNGIOShaders` target:

- **Windows:** the HLSL and the DXC runtime (`dxcompiler.dll`, `dxil.dll`); the library is compiled
  for D3D12 or Vulkan at startup, with a disk cache in the per-user cache folder (`Platform::CacheDirectory`:
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FasterNGIO\shadercache`), since the program folder may be read-only.
- **Elsewhere** (`FASTERNGIO_PRECOMPILED_SHADERS`, which can also be turned on in a Windows build to
  test it): Vulkan only, with every `QUERY_RAY`/`DEBUG_QUERIES` variant compiled to
  `shaders/GrassRejection.<ray|shape>[.debug].spv` at build time, so the executable needs no DXC.
  The build-time `dxc` is vcpkg's unless `FASTERNGIO_DXC_EXECUTABLE` names another; vcpkg's Linux
  binary needs glibc 2.38, and conda-forge's `directx-shader-compiler` runs on older systems. A new
  shader define needs a variant in `apps/FasterNGIO/CMakeLists.txt` and in `Gpu/GpuShaders.cpp`'s
  `LoadShaderLibrary`.
- **Linux binaries** link libstdc++ and libgcc statically and need only glibc and a Vulkan driver.

## Load-bearing rules

- **Parity.** With `--placement vanilla --reject none`, output reproduces the engine and must not
  drift. It places the same blades as SARP's `SARPGrassCacheGenerator --paint vanilla` except where a
  land texture carries more grass types than `iMaxGrassTypesPerTexure`: the engine tests `count > max`
  before taking each one (so the default of 2 takes 3; confirmed in the disassembly), SARP stops at
  `max`. The bytes differ in each blade's rotation words: SARP's layout suited its own renderer, while
  FasterNGIO writes the one the game's grass vertex shader reads (`EncodeBlade`; tested in
  `PlacementTests`' `BladeEncoding`), and in the block layout (see "Blocks are the engine's"). Vanilla changes must preserve the engine's RNG draw order. Linux output (both placements)
  must stay byte-identical to Windows output.
- **Game settings.** Only settings that change placement are read: `iMinGrassSize`,
  `iMaxGrassTypesPerTexure`, `fTexturePctThreshold`, all in the engine's Skyrim.ini collection, which
  loads `Skyrim.ini` then `SkyrimCustom.ini` (`SkyrimPrefs.ini` feeds only the prefs collection). The
  engine reads them through the Win32 profile API: first occurrence of a key wins, values parse as
  their leading number. Engine defaults, then INIs, then command-line values. The same collection's
  `[Archive] sResourceArchiveList`/`sResourceArchiveList2` lead the archive order (`ReadArchiveIniLists`,
  `DefaultArchiveOrder`), since mods register BSAs there.
- **Smooth placement is seam-free and calibrated.** Weights merge every shared vertex (quadrants and
  cells), blades read them at their own position, and the per-type density scale is computed over the
  whole worldspace, never the selected cells, so a cell is identical whatever a run selects. Judge
  placement changes with `tools/analyze_placement_edges.py` against vanilla and the null control.
- **Blocks are the engine's.** The game reads each `.cgid` block into a fixed 256 KiB scratch buffer
  without checking its size (76339), so an oversized block corrupts the heap (seen as tbbmalloc crashes
  under Engine Fixes). `FinalizeCell` lays blocks out as the engine's generator does: per grass type
  and quadrant (`BladeCandidate::quadrant`: vanilla's generating quadrant, smooth's by position), split
  into the model's instances per group (`BladesPerBlock`: `min(0xFFFF / (3 * tris), 0xFFFF / verts)`
  of the root's first child, measured once per run by `Grass::MeasureGrassModels`, at most 8192), with
  `AddGroup`'s descriptor (center and half extents of the stored positions, padded by 30). By default a
  type keeps at most 8191 blades per quadrant, the engine's `AddInstances` limit, thinned evenly rather
  than dropping the last batches (`--no-blade-cap`, the launcher's advanced checkbox, turns it off).
- **Water is the engine's.** The GRAS water test compares the terrain height with
  `TESObjectCELL::GetWaterHeight`: an exterior cell flagged Has Water uses its XCLW (as `Load` stores
  it: ignored from 2^31 up, else rounded), otherwise its worldspace's DNAM default (0 without one),
  taken from the parent while PNAM's Use Land Data bit is set; any other cell has no water (-FLT_MAX).
  Most exterior cells have no XCLW, so the worldspace default (Tamriel's -14000) decides the coast.
  Only water states 0-5 are tested; 6 and 7 place regardless (`PassesWaterFilter`).
- **Grass the game cannot load is not placed.** When a GRAS model is in no loose file or archive,
  `LoadGrassType` returns null: generation skips the type (no RNG draws), and loading a cache skips its
  group header but not its blocks, misreading the rest of the file. `MeasureGrassModels` lists those
  types (`missingGrass`); `PlacementSettings::unloadableGrass` makes `ForEachTextureGrass` count them
  against `iMaxGrassTypesPerTexure` without visiting them, exactly like a GRAS without a model.
- **Rejection is a post-filter.** NGIO's own hook skips the colour/orientation/height RNG draws for a
  rejected blade; FasterNGIO deliberately keeps the vanilla layout and only drops blades, or (grass
  cliffs) moves them: `Grass::MoveBlade` re-encodes a blade from the draws `BladeCandidate` keeps.
- **NGIO's settings are one implicit input.** `GrassControl.ini` in `Data/SKSE/Plugins` and the
  `*_NGIO.ini` files in `Data` are read at the start of every run (`App::LoadNgioSettingsFor`,
  logged), folded into the options where the command line chose nothing (`ApplyNgioSettings`), and
  their form lists resolved once the load order is known (`ResolveNgioFeatures`). Missing keys take
  NGIO's defaults, including its quirks (`Ray-cast-mode` is never applied). Without the file, or with
  `--ngio-config none`, a run is exactly the plain one: the parity checks pass `none`.
- **Seasons of Skyrim is the second implicit input.** `App::LoadSeasonsSettingsFor` detects
  `po3_SeasonsOfSkyrim.dll`, reads its INI and `Data/Seasons`, and `Seasons::GenerateWinterSwaps`
  ports Seasons' automatic winter rules (form-array order, Tweaks-only editor IDs, material IDs as
  BSCRC32 of the MATT name). Each world runs one pass per distinct set of swaps
  (`PlanSeasonPasses`); a pass writes its cells under every suffix it covers, and passes with object
  swaps get their own `WorldIndex` (`RejectionFeatures::baseSwaps`). The plain `.cgid` is always the
  unswapped pass, identical to a run with `--seasons off`.
- **Render geometry is opt-in and collision-gated.** `--render-geometry` (the launcher's experimental
  checkbox, `RejectionFeatures::renderGeometry`) swaps a model's collision for its solid render
  triangles only when the model has collision in a kept layer, so the set of rejecting objects is
  NGIO's; the triangles go through the existing mesh path on every backend. Off, a run is unchanged.
- **One per-blade decision.** What a blade's volume touched (`Rejection::VolumeHits`, by instance
  role) and, for cliff candidates, its cliff rays (`CliffRays`) come from the GPU's two passes, the CPU
  BVH or the brute-force reference; `Rejection::DecideBlade` (`NgioRules.cpp`) alone turns them into
  rejected, kept or moved. A world without cliff or ignored-shape instances (`UsesRoles`) takes the
  plain single-bit path everywhere.
- **One source of geometric truth.** Exact overlap tests live in `shaders/Shared/GrassQueryMath.hlsli`
  and are compiled by the GPU, the CPU BVH and the brute-force reference (`PrimitiveTests.h` wraps
  them per primitive). That includes the hull test, a template over how each side stores hulls
  (`BufferHull` in the shader, `ModelHull` in C++), and the segment hits the grass cliffs use
  (`SegmentHit*`). Change them there, never in one copy. Likewise the buffer layouts the C++ fills
  and the shader reads (model records, root constants, debug records, volume and cliff results, the
  instance roles) and NGIO's cliff constants are defined once, in `shaders/Shared/RejectionLayout.hlsli`.
- **Arguments mean the command line, unchanged.** No arguments (or `--gui`) opens the launcher; any
  other arguments, as MO2 passes them, must behave exactly as before. The launcher only builds
  `GenerateOptions` and calls `App::Run`, so anything generation does belongs in `FasterNGIOApp`
  (`Generate.cpp`, `WorldSetup.cpp`), not `Gui/`.
  A world's output must not depend on whether it ran alone or under `--world all`.
- **Mod Organizer 2 only supplies defaults.** Under MO2 (usvfs is loaded), `Platform::DetectModOrganizer`
  reads the instance's `ModOrganizer.ini`: its game, its selected profile's `plugins.txt` and
  (`LocalSettings`) INIs. The CLI uses these only for a missing `--data`, `--plugins` or `--out`, and
  never looks them up when all three are given; the launcher shows them in place of the game folder.
  Output still goes through the VFS (`Data\Grass`, which MO2 sends to Overwrite), as NGIO's own
  pregeneration does.
- **Fallback is decided up front.** `GpuRejector` checks every feature it needs before any work is
  posted and throws `GpuUnsupportedError` listing what is missing; `--reject auto` then uses the CPU
  BVH. Add any new GPU requirement to that check.
- **Files are written by the writer threads.** `Pipeline::FileWriterPool` (one thread by default,
  `--writers`) writes every `.cgid`, one call per file; workers only serialize and queue, and suspend
  in the graph while the backlog is over budget. File creation is serialized by NTFS and antivirus
  scanning (about 150-300 us per file here, whatever the thread count), so it bounds a full run; a
  world's pipeline returns once its files are queued so the next world prepares meanwhile. A cell
  left with no grass gets no file by default (`skipEmptyCells`; `--write-empty-cells` and the
  launcher's advanced checkbox restore NGIO's 4-byte one); with `--overwrite`, its old file is removed
  (only names the output folder listed at the start, since a remove call costs as much as a write).
- **No locks on the hot paths.** Workers and the render thread communicate through the AsyncStateGraph
  (producers, GPU submission tokens, capacity suspensions) and `Pipeline::MpscQueue`. The CPU BVH,
  `SmoothWeightField` and `DataDirectory` are built up front and immutable afterwards. Do not add mutexes or condition variables to the
  cell pipeline, `GpuRejector` or the rejection structures.
- **DXR payload.** The hit result is written by the closest-hit and miss shaders. Do not reintroduce
  `RAY_FLAG_SKIP_CLOSEST_HIT_SHADER` and rely on the payload surviving a traversal that runs neither:
  on NVIDIA it does not. Nor rely on a shader reading the payload the ray-generation shader
  initialised: on D3D12 (NVIDIA) the cliff pass's any-hit shader received garbage where Vulkan was
  correct, so its rays gather their hits in scratch words of the output buffer instead
  (`kCliffWordScratch`), one lane per slot.

## Validation

- `--validate-cpu` re-runs every cell through the brute-force CPU reference and reports
  disagreements: none for the CPU BVH, a handful of float-precision edge cases per million blades
  for the GPU.
- `--benchmark-rejection` places every selected cell in memory and times the CPU BVH (all threads and
  one) and the GPU on the same queries, without file I/O.
- `FASTERNGIO_DEBUG_CANDIDATE=<frame-global candidate index>` selects the shader variant with debug capture and logs
  every raygen/intersection invocation for that candidate. Use with `--cell` so the index is the cell's
  query index.
- `--export-blades <file>` writes every placed blade (x, y, grass form ID) for the selected cells;
  `tools/analyze_placement_edges.py` measures it.
- `--collision-survey` and `--dump-collision <model> <obj>` inspect collision extraction;
  `FASTERNGIO_SURVEY_DUMP=<file>` makes the survey write per-model primitive counts for diffing builds
  or platforms.
