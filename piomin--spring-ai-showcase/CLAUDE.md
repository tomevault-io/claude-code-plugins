### AI Agents Best Practices for Code Generation

This document outlines the best practices for generating code within this repository using AI agents, specifically optimized for Anthropic models (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet) used via OpenCode.

#### 1. Contextual Awareness
*   **Provide System Context:** When asking for changes, ensure the agent understands the architecture used here (Spring Boot, Spring AI, Maven).
*   **Reference Existing Patterns:** Direct the agent to look at existing implementations in the `pl.piomin.services.controller` package to maintain consistency in coding style, error handling, and documentation.

#### 2. Prompting Techniques
*   **Be Specific:** Instead of "add a new endpoint," use "add a GET endpoint to `PersonController` that returns a list of persons."
*   **Iterative Development:** For complex features, break down the request into smaller, manageable steps (e.g., model -> repository/service -> controller).
*   **Request Tests:** Always ask the agent to generate corresponding unit or integration tests (using JUnit 5 and Spring Boot Test as seen in the project).

#### 3. Code Quality and Style
*   **Maintain Consistency:** Ensure the generated code follows the existing Java 21 features and Spring Boot/Spring AI conventions.
*   **Review Generated Code:** Always review the AI-generated code for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and adherence to project-specific rules.

#### 4. Critical Restriction: Target Directory
*   **Do Not Commit `target/`:** Under no circumstances should the `target` directory (or any of its contents) be added or committed to the repository. The `target` directory contains build artifacts that are generated locally and should be ignored by Git.

#### 5. OpenCode Integration
*   **Use File References:** Leverage OpenCode's ability to reference specific files to provide precise context to the Anthropic model.
*   **Verify Build:** After applying changes suggested by the agent, always run `mvn clean compile` to ensure the project still builds correctly.
