# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents working in this repository. This is the [agentskills.io / agents-md](https://agentskills.io) convention for tool-agnostic agent guidance; per-tool files like `CLAUDE.md` may add tool-specific rules on top.

## What this repo is

The Primitive SDKs monorepo. Four published artifacts, all generated from the same OpenAPI spec at `openapi/primitive-api.yaml`:

| Path | Package | Install |
|---|---|---|
| `sdk-node/` | `@primitivedotdev/sdk` | `npm install @primitivedotdev/sdk` |
| `sdk-python/` | `primitivedotdev` (PyPI) | `pip install primitivedotdev` |
| `sdk-go/` | `github.com/primitivedotdev/sdks/sdk-go` | `go get github.com/primitivedotdev/sdks/sdk-go@latest` |
| `cli-node/` | `primitive` | `npm install -g primitive` |

Plus one workspace-internal package at `packages/api-core/` that ships the generated TypeScript API client and is bundled inline into the Node SDK + CLI.

The CLI consumes the Node SDK and exposes `primitive <verb>` commands. The SDKs are the canonical programmatic interface to `https://api.primitive.dev/v1`.

## Source of truth

`openapi/primitive-api.yaml` is the single source for the API surface. Everything else regenerates from it:

- `openapi/primitive-api.codegen.json` (normalized JSON form for codegen tools)
- `packages/api-core/src/api/` (Node fetch client + types via `@hey-api/openapi-ts`)
- `packages/api-core/src/openapi/openapi.generated.ts` (the OpenAPI document embedded as a TS constant)
- `sdk-python/src/primitive/api/` (via `openapi-python-client`)
- `sdk-go/api/` (via in-repo Python scripts)

Touching `primitive-api.yaml` means regenerating each downstream artifact in this list.

The other source-of-truth file is `json-schema/email-received-event.schema.json`, the inbound webhook event payload schema. It is independent of the OpenAPI spec; touching it regenerates a separate set of artifacts:

- `sdk-node/src/schema.generated.ts` + `src/types.generated.ts` + `src/generated/email-received-event.validator.generated.ts`
- `sdk-python/src/primitive/models_generated.py` + `src/primitive/schemas/email_received_event.schema.json`
- `sdk-go/schema_generated.go`

The two sources do not overlap: an edit to `primitive-api.yaml` will not refresh `models_generated.py`, and an edit to the JSON schema will not refresh `api/`. Both regen targets are wired into `make node-generate python-generate go-generate`.

## Build, test, lint

The Makefile orchestrates per-language targets. The common ones an agent will reach for:

```bash
# Regenerate everything from the spec (run after editing primitive-api.yaml)
make node-generate python-generate go-generate

# Run the per-language full check (includes generated-file-sync gate)
make node-check          # @primitivedotdev/sdk + packages/api-core
make cli-check           # primitive
make python-check        # primitivedotdev (PyPI)
make go-check            # sdk-go

# Cross-SDK behavior parity tests
make shared-check

# Build artifacts
make node-build cli-build python-build go-build

# Convenience aggregator
make check               # runs all of the above except the smokes
```

Before pushing any branch, the minimum is `make node-check cli-check go-check shared-check`. If you touched the JSON schema OR the OpenAPI spec, also run `make python-check`.

## Generated files are committed

This is intentional. Every regen target writes back into `git` and CI uses `git diff --exit-code` to assert the committed artifacts match a fresh regen. If you forget to commit a regenerated file, CI fails with a clear diff.

Do not edit any file marked `generated` in its header. Edit the source (the YAML spec or the JSON schema), run the regen target, commit both.

## Cross-SDK consistency

All three language SDKs must behave identically for the same input. Shared fixtures in `test-fixtures/` are the contract; the `make shared-check` target runs the same fixtures against all three SDKs. If you change behavior in one, update all three.

## Style and quality bar

- Zero warnings. Lints run with `--error-on-warnings` (Biome for TS, ruff + basedpyright for Python, gofmt + go vet for Go). A single warning fails the build.
- Do not silence warnings with `// biome-ignore`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`, or equivalents. Fix the underlying issue. If a true escape hatch is needed, document the WHY inline and link to the upstream bug.
- No `any` in TypeScript without a documented reason.
- New endpoints need typed schemas in the OpenAPI spec, including response schemas; the regen relies on them.

## Branching and PRs

- Never push to `main`. Always branch + open a PR.
- Branch names: plain descriptive (`add-foo-verb`), not Conventional-Commit-prefixed.
- Commit messages: plain descriptive ("Add foo verb"), not `feat: add foo verb`.
- After opening a PR, expect Greptile to auto-review within ~1-3 minutes. Address every finding (inline threads AND summary table) before merging.
- The CI surface lives in `.github/workflows/sdk-checks.yml`. The `ci` aggregator job gates on every language job.

## Public-repo writing

This repo is **public**. Anything that lands in `git log`, PR descriptions, issue bodies, or code comments is visible to users, competitors, and anyone evaluating the product.

- Do not reference internal Primitive repos by URL, PR number, branch name, or as a noun.
- Do not leak infrastructure details (cluster ARNs, internal hostnames, vendor specifics).
- Commit messages and PR titles describe WHAT changed and WHY, not HOW our infra is wired.
- Flag anything that reads as a business decision (pricing, roadmap timing, SLA commitments) before merging -- those need a human call.

## Adding a new API verb

1. Add the operation to `openapi/primitive-api.yaml` with operationId, summary, full request/response schemas.
2. `make node-generate python-generate go-generate` to regenerate clients in all three languages.
3. If the verb deserves a CLI shortcut, add a command under `cli-node/src/oclif/commands/` and a test under `cli-node/tests/oclif/`.
4. Add or update test fixtures in `test-fixtures/` if cross-SDK behavior parity matters for this verb.
5. `make check` to confirm everything passes locally.
6. Commit the SOURCE changes (yaml, command, fixtures) AND the regenerated files in the same commit.

## Where to find more

- `CLAUDE.md` -- project-specific rules layered on top of this file. Same content philosophy, Claude-Code-tuned vocabulary.
- `RELEASE.md` -- how SDK releases are cut.
- `docs/` -- design notes and architecture decisions.
- Each language directory has its own README with install + quickstart for that surface.
