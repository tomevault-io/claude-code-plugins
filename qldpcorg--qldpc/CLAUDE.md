# Agent and contributor guide

This guide is for people and agents changing qLDPC.
For a human-facing explanation of the data model and package relationships, start with the [library map](docs/source/library_map.rst).
For exact signatures and per-object literature, use the source docstrings or the generated [API reference](https://qldpc.readthedocs.io/autoapi/index.html).

## What to trust when documents disagree

When sources disagree, use this order:

1. Current implementation and its invariant tests.
2. Public docstrings and the `__all__` lists in package `__init__.py` files.
3. The [library map](docs/source/library_map.rst) and executable [examples](examples/).
4. Historical discussion, issues, or review notes.

Re-derive behavior from the current branch before documenting or changing it.
Do not copy transient project history, machine-specific paths, or local-session instructions into production files.

## Public API and compatibility

- [`src/qldpc/__init__.py`](src/qldpc/__init__.py) exports subpackages rather than flattening their classes and functions.
- Each stable subpackage has an explicit `__all__` in its `__init__.py`.
  Preserve those import paths when moving implementation code.
- Treat imports from ordinary `qldpc.*` packages as public and keep them working.
  Use a tested `DeprecationWarning` shim for a necessary rename or move rather than breaking an import.
  For a renamed module-level name, see [`qldpc._util.get_deprecated_alias`](src/qldpc/_util.py).
- Everything under [`src/qldpc/experimental/`](src/qldpc/experimental/) is explicitly unstable and can change without a deprecation period.
  Do not infer that this weaker guarantee applies elsewhere.
- Keep complete lists of public symbols in `__all__` and AutoAPI.
  Human-written docs should explain what packages do and show representative tasks, not duplicate a class catalogue.
- A module should not use a private (underscore-prefixed) name from another module unless it is a narrowly shared internal helper or an intentional decoder-composition boundary.
  For example, `decoders/construction/resolution.py` calls private backend builders kept beside their implementations; they are not public APIs merely because the resolver imports them.
  Otherwise, needing a cross-module private name indicates that it should be public and documented.
  A test module may use private names of the module that it tests.

## Module organization and ordering

- Preserve a module's existing section headings and organization when adding code.
- Add a section when new functionality does not fit an existing one.
- Put important user-facing APIs first within modules and sections.
- Keep related public entry points together.
- Place private implementation helpers toward the bottom of the relevant section or module.
- Keep user-facing decode methods near the top of decoder classes.
- Place private helper methods after the public decode methods.

The main code hierarchy is:

```text
AbstractCode
|- ClassicalCode
`- QuditCode
   `- CSSCode
```

The methods in `codes/common.py` share cached and mutable state for standard form, logical and gauge operators, parameters, and code transformations.
Do not split them into mixins merely to reduce the file length.
Free-standing statistical Monte Carlo helpers live in `codes/monte_carlo.py`.
Code-capacity detector-error-model and decoder orchestration lives in `codes/code_capacity.py`.
Generic decoder-input checks live in `decoders/capabilities.py`; field-valued and bit-packed observable-decoder adapters live in `decoders/adapters/observable_decoders.py`.
Immediate builders live beside their implementations: external-package integrations under `decoders/external/`, and qLDPC-owned implementations under `decoders/custom/`.
Typed decoder specifications, generic input resolution, and deprecated keyword translation live under `decoders/construction/`.
Modern decoder inputs resolve directly in `decoders/construction/resolution.py`; nonempty deprecated keywords enter `decoders/construction/legacy.py` for translation, and the package-root compatibility calls remain there.

## Core invariants

### Fields and arrays

- Code arithmetic happens in a `galois.FieldArray`.
  The default field is `GF(2)`.
- Extension-field storage integers are not ordinary integers modulo the field order.
  Do not use `% field.order` as field coercion; construct or preserve values through the field class.
- Preserve the concrete field when copying or transforming arrays.
  Code equality and compatibility often require the same field class, not merely arrays with equal integer views.
- A `RingArray` has one base `GroupRing`.
  NumPy operations must reject arrays from incompatible rings, including arrays supplied through keyword arguments such as `out=`.

### Codes and Pauli conventions

- A classical parity-check matrix `H` defines words satisfying `H @ word == 0`.
- A general quantum check is a symplectic row `[X | Z]` of even length.
  Use [`qldpc.math.symplectic_conjugate`](src/qldpc/math.py) rather than hand-writing sign and half-order conventions.
- A CSS code stores X-type and Z-type checks separately.
  Commuting stabilizer checks satisfy `H_x @ H_z.T == 0` in the code's field.
- For a subsystem code, constructor check rows generate the gauge group and need not commute.
  Stabilizers come from the center.
  Do not decode a subsystem code as though all gauge generators were stabilizers.
- `CSSCode(..., promise_equal_distance_xz=True)` is trusted, not verified.
  A false promise can make distance results wrong and dependent on which sector was computed first.
- Built-in families may cache construction- or literature-supplied parameters.
  A test that compares `get_code_params()` only with those same cached values is tautological; use an independent rank, commutation, row-space, or bounded-distance oracle.
- [`codes/distance.py`](src/qldpc/codes/distance.py) is explicitly binary.
  Use field-aware code methods and oracles for nonbinary constructions.

### Decoders

- Build decoders from typed specifications, as in `decoders.bp_osd(...).build(pcm_or_dem)` or `decoders.mwpm(...).build_observable_decoder(dem)`.
  Builders named `get_decoder_<NAME>`, `get_error_decoder`, and `get_observable_decoder` are deprecated and live only in [`construction/legacy.py`](src/qldpc/decoders/construction/legacy.py).
- `decoder=None` selects GUF for a nonbinary `FieldArray` and BP+OSD otherwise (see [`construction/resolution.py`](src/qldpc/decoders/construction/resolution.py)).
- Keep error decoders (`decode_errors`, with `decode` as an alias) distinct from observable decoders (`decode_observables`).
  Code that consumes a user-supplied error decoder coerces it with `decoders.as_error_decoder` and calls `decode_errors`.
- A method that decodes a matrix it constructs itself must reject prebuilt decoders with `decoders.reject_prebuilt_decoder`.
- Code-capacity estimators resolve their `decoder=`, `decoder_x=`, and `decoder_z=` inputs with [`codes.code_capacity.get_code_capacity_decoder`](src/qldpc/codes/code_capacity.py), which always yields an observable decoder: on binary codes, specifications with native observable support build it from a DEM; otherwise inferred errors can be projected onto logical predictions.
  Keep `decoders.resolve_decoder` error-decoder-specific, and dispatch on explicit capabilities (`compile_decoder_for_dem`, `decode_observables`, the `ErrorDecoder` protocol), never on output length.
- Only decoders that declare erasure support may append an erasure flag.
  They append that flag as the last entry of each inferred error; unsupported decoders must reject `add_erasure_bit=True`.
- Detector-error-model decomposition indices and remaps must remain valid after cancellation and simplification.
  Test malformed components, not only happy-path Stim models.
- Sliding-window time inference is heuristic.
  Preserve the first nondecreasing detector coordinate convention, and use an explicit `detector_to_time` mapping when a model follows another layout.

### Circuits

- Circuit and tableau constructors are qubit-only and should use the existing `restrict_to_qubits` guard.
- `get_encoding_circuit` constructs a valid encoder but is not fault-tolerant.
  Do not present it as a fault-tolerant state-preparation procedure.
- Transversal-gate search enumerates automorphisms and can be exponential.
- Keep data, check, reference, and ancilla roles explicit through `QubitIDs` and bookkeeping types.
  Do not infer roles from coincident integer indices.
- qLDPC memory-circuit detectors use coordinates such as `(round, 0, check_index)`.
  A later monotone coordinate can enumerate checks rather than time.
- Noise-model operation immunity and qubit immunity are separate controls; preserve both.

### External systems, caching, and tests

- GAP helpers may start subprocesses, read standard input, use the clipboard, access the network, or clone missing packages.
  Keep these side effects explicit in docstrings and error messages.
- Tests run with network sockets disabled.
  Mock optional web, subprocess, clipboard, and prompt paths; do not add a live-service test.
- Disk caches are bypassed while pytest is imported.
  Tests must not depend on cache persistence.
- Expensive reusable computations should use `qldpc.cache.use_disk_cache()`.
  Do not hide errors by returning a default value that looks successful.
- Statement coverage is gated at 100%.
  Co-located `*_test.py` files are the strong convention, although a thin helper can be covered through its consumer's test module.
- Pytest turns every `DeprecationWarning` into an error, so tests must use the modern API.
  A test of a deprecated path must assert its warning with `pytest.warns(DeprecationWarning, ...)`.

## Common change recipes

### Add or change a code construction

1. Put a classical family in [`codes/classical.py`](src/qldpc/codes/classical.py) and a quantum or CSS family in [`codes/quantum.py`](src/qldpc/codes/quantum.py), next to its closest base or sibling.
2. Re-export public names from [`codes/__init__.py`](src/qldpc/codes/__init__.py).
3. Add a linked literature reference and document the field, subsystem, distance, and validation assumptions in the class docstring.
4. Add co-located tests with independent invariants: rank-derived dimension, CSS orthogonality, symplectic commutation, row-space identities, known small distances, or exact cross-family equivalence.
5. Verify a regression test has teeth by checking that it fails when the intended mechanism is removed or perturbed.

### Change code-core algebra

1. Read the cached-state interactions in [`codes/common.py`](src/qldpc/codes/common.py) before changing standard form, logicals, stabilizers, gauges, dimension, or distance.
2. Test both CSS and non-CSS paths, stabilizer and subsystem paths, `k=0`, and at least one odd characteristic when signs matter.
3. Preserve public imports and invalidate or transfer cached values deliberately.

### Add or adapt a decoder

Follow the [adding a decoder guide](docs/source/adding_decoders.rst) for a custom-decoder example and a first-party backend checklist.

1. Put integrations with third-party decoder packages under [`decoders/external/`](src/qldpc/decoders/external/), and qLDPC-owned implementations under [`decoders/custom/`](src/qldpc/decoders/custom/).
2. Keep each immediate builder beside the implementation it constructs.
   Add a typed specification under [`decoders/construction/`](src/qldpc/decoders/construction/) when exposing an algorithm.
   Do not change generic resolution for an ordinary backend.
   Export concrete backend classes at qualified `custom` or `external` paths, and export public specification helpers from [`decoders/__init__.py`](src/qldpc/decoders/__init__.py).
   Derive each specification helper's signature from one typed builder or constructor, write its public docstring explicitly, and add it to the `autofunction` inventory in [`decoders.rst`](docs/source/decoders.rst).
   Keep deprecated keyword translation isolated in `construction/legacy.py`.
3. Decide and test batch behavior, nonbinary support, detector-error-model support, and erasure signaling explicitly.
4. Use direct syndrome/error reproductions in addition to factory-selection tests.

### Change a circuit workflow

1. Keep matrix, qubit-role, measurement-record, detector-record, and Stim-circuit bookkeeping in sync.
2. Test noiseless detector determinism and observable behavior before adding noise.
3. Exercise repeated rounds and seam behavior; a locally valid circuit fragment can still become wrong when initialization, QEC cycles, and readout are joined.
4. State computational and fault-tolerance limitations in the relevant function or class docstring.

### Change an external integration

1. Separate parsing/encoding logic from process, network, clipboard, and prompt mechanics.
2. Test both the callable-tool path and the absent/manual/error paths without live resources.
3. For finite fields, round-trip values through the external system's actual element encoding; do not assume integer storage conventions match.
4. Report nonzero return codes, standard error, malformed output, and missing data clearly.

### Add documentation or an example

1. Put explanations that span packages in [`docs/source/library_map.rst`](docs/source/library_map.rst), exact API behavior in docstrings, and executable workflows in [`examples/`](examples/).
2. The notebooks under `docs/source/examples/` are links to the canonical files under `examples/`.
   Edit the canonical notebook, not the documentation-tree link.
3. Keep README and the library map selective.
   AutoAPI provides the complete list of public symbols.
4. When a public limitation changes, update the relevant function or class docstring and every README or guide that repeats it in the same pull request.
5. Keep one prose sentence per physical source line in `.rst`, `.md`, and Markdown notebook cells.
   Put `First sentence.` and `Second sentence.` on separate source lines; leave code blocks, equations, and table syntax intact.
6. Run the strict documentation build before considering the change complete.

## Validation commands

Install the development environment:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

Use the smallest targeted command while iterating, then the full gate before merging:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `python checks/all_.py` | Complete repository gate: formatting, lint, strict mypy, tests, 100% coverage, and docs |
| `python checks/pytest_.py` | Full Python pytest suite; does not execute notebooks by default |
| `python checks/pytest_.py src/qldpc/codes/` | Tests for one package |
| `python checks/pytest_.py --notebook examples/decoders.ipynb examples/basics.ipynb examples/noise_models.ipynb` | Execute the three complete, CI-allowlisted notebooks with their dependencies installed |
| `python -m pytest src/qldpc/codes/quantum_test.py::test_name -v` | One focused test |
| `python checks/format_.py --check` | Verify Ruff and `pyproject.toml` formatting |
| `python checks/format_.py` | Apply repository formatting |
| `python checks/lint_.py` | Ruff lint |
| `python checks/mypy_.py` | Strict mypy over source and tests |
| `python checks/coverage_.py` | Modular 100% statement-coverage gate |
| `python checks/build_docs.py` | Strict Sphinx and notebook documentation build |

The docs build renders saved notebook outputs without executing code cells.
Refresh outputs by executing the entire canonical notebook in an offline, editable installation before changing a notebook example.
Pass an absolute path to this checkout's `src` directory in `PYTHONPATH` if a notebook runner starts its kernel from `examples/`.
The TQEC notebook requires Python 3.11--3.13 because its pinned TQEC dependency does not support Python 3.14.

Some check wrappers discover files through Git.
Add new source and test files to the index before relying on the full gate to include them.
Do not weaken a failure with `noqa`, `type: ignore`, or coverage exclusions unless the exceptional condition is real and documented.
