# harness-cli

> - Prefer repo-local `.grok/skills` and `.grok/agents` for AIOS-enhanced surfaces.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/harness-cli/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

## AIOS Native Grok Build Layer

- Prefer repo-local `.grok/skills` and `.grok/agents` for AIOS-enhanced surfaces.
- Keep work grounded in the AIOS runtime and verification flow.
- Native sync writes `.grok/hooks/aios-workflow.json` (`aios plan hook-user-prompt --client grok`). Absent until `aios internal native update`. Enable those project hooks with `/hooks-trust` once.
- Follow the shared workflow policy before selecting a plan, skill, team, or harness route.
- Grok Build also loads shared `.agents/skills` and Claude-compat paths; prefer AIOS-managed roots for project-shared skills.
- Token compression is handled by community tools RTK + Caveman (installed via `aios init`).
