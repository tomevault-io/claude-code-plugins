# AGENTS.md: review agent guidelines (host-agnostic)

## Plugin architecture

This plugin implements a single principle:

> **The partner reviews, never the host.**

For every review (plan, code, or prompt — all through the single `adversarial-review` skill):

- The agent reading the SKILL.md is the **host**.
- The host **must not** review the host's own work.
- The host runs `lib/call-external.sh` to delegate the heavy critique to the
  OTHER agent (the **partner**).
- The host then runs its own independent analysis and **cross-validates**
  against the partner's output, tagging findings as `[cross-validated]`,
  `[external-only]`, or `[host-only]`.

There is **no haiku courier subagent** in this version. The host (main
session) does both the external dispatch and the synthesis. Removed in the
0.5.0 refactor: the courier added complexity (model inconsistency across
files, blocking-vs-non-blocking ambiguity) without proportionate value.

## Cross-host routing

| Detected host | Partner |
|---------------|---------|
| `claude` | Claude authors (default): T1 Astra high via Pi, then `codex exec`; T2 Pi chain; T3 Gemini. Codex authors: T1 is the Claude main loop inline; wrapper adds T2/T3, never Codex |
| `codex` | Codex/user/unknown authors: T1 `claude -p`; Claude/Pi/Grok authors: T1 Codex Astra. Then T2 Pi chain (non-xAI for Grok authors), T3 Gemini |
| `grok` | Codex Astra, then Gemini |
| `pi` | Codex Astra, then Claude, direct xAI, then Gemini |
| `unknown` | Direct xAI, then Pi, then Gemini |


Detection happens at every invocation via `lib/detect-host.sh`. See
`references/host-detection.md` for the priority order and the env-leak
asymmetry that drives "Codex env first, Claude env second".

Codex- and Claude-host callers should set `ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW_AUTHOR` to `codex`,
`grok`, `claude`, `pi`, `user`, or `unknown`. Aliases `sol`, `openai`, `astra`,
`xai`, and `anthropic` are accepted case-insensitively. On Codex, omitted authors
infer `codex`; `user` and `unknown` follow the same Grok-first route. On Claude,
omitted authors infer `claude`.

## Anti-recursion contract

`lib/call-external.sh` reads `ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW_DEPTH` (default `0`). If
it sees `≥ 1`, it refuses with exit `1`. Before invoking the partner, it
sets `ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW_DEPTH=1` in the partner's env. So if a launched
partner ever re-triggers this skill, the guard fires. Never disable.

## Critique discipline (v0.8.1+)

- **Stance**: break confidence; do not validate. No credit for intent or likely follow-up.
- **Attack surface**: prioritize expensive failures (auth/trust, data loss, rollback/idempotency, races, degraded deps, migrations, observability gaps).
- **Finding bar**: material only — what fails, why vulnerable, impact, concrete fix. Prefer one strong finding over many weak ones. Clean review with zero findings is valid.
- **Over-engineering**: every plan/code review runs a simplicity counterfactual with required behavior and safety held fixed. Challenge YAGNI, false seams, duplicate ownership, and missed in-repo reuse, including canonical Effect implementations. LOC or framework taste alone is never a finding. An OE finding requires a path/line or plan-section anchor, cited evidence plus material failure/cost/risk, and a simpler alternative that preserves behavior and safety; see `references/output-standards.md`.
- **Focus**: user focus weights the pass; other material issues still report.
- **Summary**: terse ship/no-ship first (≤200 tokens), not a neutral recap.
- Details: `references/codex-lessons.md`, `references/output-standards.md`.

## Output integrity (for synthesis by the host)

Every finding in the final output MUST include:

1. **Severity**: P0 (critical) / P1 (high) / P2 (medium) / P3 (low)
2. **Evidence**: direct quote, file:line reference, or concrete scenario
3. **Impact**: user/data/security/ops consequence
4. **Recommendation**: specific, actionable fix
5. **Confidence**: high | medium | low
6. **Origin tag**: `[cross-validated]` / `[external-only]` / `[host-only]`
   (from the cross-validation step)

Do not invent files, lines, or attack chains. Mark inferences.

## Severity scale

| Level | Meaning                                                | Action                       |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| P0    | Critical: exploitable, data loss, security breach      | Must fix before merge/deploy |
| P1    | High: significant risk, likely failure mode            | Should fix in this iteration |
| P2    | Medium: material quality/reliability, limited blast    | Fix when convenient          |
| P3    | Low: only if still material — not style dump           | Optional improvement         |

## Fallback chain

See `references/fallback-chain.md` and the SKILL.md roster. Order is host and author aware: T1 Claude/Codex cross-review, T2 Pi chain (non-xAI for Grok authors), T3 Gemini, then a same-family clean-context subagent, then DEGRADED mode. **The DEGRADED mode emits an explicit banner** in stdout and
returns exit 2 from `call-external.sh` so the SKILL knows to surface it to
the user.

## Honesty rules

- When a review is clean, say so. Do not manufacture findings.
- When uncertain about severity, use confidence tags.
- When input is ambiguous, ask; don't guess.
- When degraded mode triggers, **always show the banner**. Silent self-review
  is the failure mode this plugin was designed to prevent.

## What this plugin does NOT cover

- **Live multi-turn dialog with the partner.** The call is one-shot:
  prompt in, analysis out. If you need iteration, the host asks the user;
  the user asks the partner directly via the partner's interactive UI.
- **Approval workflows.** This plugin produces critiques, not approvals.
  Merge / ship decisions remain the user's.
- **State persistence across calls.** Each `lib/call-external.sh` invocation
  is independent. State that needs to persist lives in host memory
  (`~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/memory/` or `~/.codex/memories/`).

## Entry points

- Claude Code: `/adversarial-review:adversarial-review`, the single entry point.
  It classifies the input (plan, code, prompt) and runs the matching procedure.
- Codex: `$adversarial-review` after `bash adapters/codex-skill/install.sh`
  (symlinks into `~/.codex/skills/`).
- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` is the single source of truth for every host.

## Dev gotchas

- **`forced_login_method = "chatgpt"`** must be in `~/.codex/config.toml` for
  ChatGPT-account users. Without it, `codex exec` can return 404 "Model not
  found" even though the TUI works. See `references/codex-integration.md`.
- **Codex reviewer** needs `--sandbox read-only`, `-m gpt-6-astra`, an explicit
  `-c model_reasoning_effort` (`high` on host Claude, `medium` elsewhere) and
  `--skip-git-repo-check`, since the prompt is the unit of review.
- **Direct xAI through Grok CLI** uses `grok-4.7` with `--reasoning-effort xhigh`
  and inherited `XAI_API_KEY` (not OpenRouter). The script checks `grok models`
  and skips unavailable entries.
- **Pi model chain (T2)** runs `pi -p --mode text --tools read,grep,find,ls --model`
  from the caller's repo or worktree root. Default order is the SKILL.md roster:
  `opencode-go/deepseek-v4.1-flash:xhigh`, `opencode-go/glm-5.3:high`,
  `xai-oauth/grok-4.7:high`. Do not run it from `/tmp` when opencode-go keys
  resolve through Doppler scope.
- **Antigravity fallback** runs `agy models`, then tries `gemini-3.8-flash-high`,
  `gemini-3.7-flash-high`, and `gemini-3.1-pro-high`, each one-shot with `-p`,
  `--model`, `--sandbox`, and `--mode plan`. Never use `-c` or continue.
- **Long prompts (>~6 kB) can stall the Codex backend.** Summarize huge inputs
  instead of pasting them raw; a 200+ line plan once stalled `codex exec` for
  20+ min at 0% CPU.
- **`"skills": "./skills/"`** is required in `plugin.json` for Claude Code to
  discover SKILL.md files.
- **Global gitignore** at `~/.config/git/ignore` blocks
  `.claude/settings.local.json`; use `git add -f` to include it.
- No single file in this plugin should exceed 500 lines.

## Dev workflow (Claude Code plugin)

- Edit source at `/Users/macbook/repos/skills/plugins/adversarial-review/`.
- The plugin cache at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` does not follow source edits.
  Reinstall after changes:
  ```bash
  claude plugin uninstall adversarial-review 2>/dev/null || true
  claude plugin marketplace add ~/repos/skills/plugins/adversarial-review
  claude plugin install adversarial-review@adversarial-review
  ```
  Then `/reload-plugins` in the current session.
