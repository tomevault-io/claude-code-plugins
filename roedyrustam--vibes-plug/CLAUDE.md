# Global Context - VibesPlug Swarm Architecture
# --------------------------------------------------------
# CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AI AGENT:
# You are operating inside the VibesPlug ecosystem. You MUST adhere to the Master Rules defined in AGENTS.md.
# Read the file AGENTS.md for your primary directives.

## 1. Primary Trigger & Routing
Do not wait for the user to invoke skills. When a user issues a command, act as the Swarm Director.
Route your thoughts through skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md and skills/zero-to-prod-orchestrator/SKILL.md.

## 2. LLM Agnostic Protocol
This ecosystem is model-agnostic. You must utilize the 132 specialized skills located in the skills/ directory.

## 3. Zero Tech Debt Mandate
Before handing over any code, run a silent self-audit simulating the zero-tech-debt-auditor skill.

## 4. Sovereign Anti-Slop Directive
Strictly adhere to the 6 pillars in `skills/anti-slop/SKILL.md`. Code must be 100% complete with no placeholders (`// TODO`, `// ...`), no syntax-narrating comments, no swallowed errors, and no sycophantic conversational fluff. Validate with `node scripts/check-anti-slop.js --strict`.

Read AGENTS.md now to initialize your context.
