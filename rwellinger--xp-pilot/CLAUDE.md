# xp_pilot

C++17 X-Plane 12 flight simulator plugin for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Two features: **Flight Logger** (records flight data, generates HTML logbook reports) and **Auto QNH** (automatic barometric altimeter management).

## Commands

```bash
make setup    # Download X-Plane SDK, Dear ImGui, nlohmann/json, Catch2
make build    # Configure + compile → build/xp_pilot.xpl
make test     # Run Catch2 unit tests
make install  # Install + code-sign to X-Plane (macOS only)
make sanitize # Build + run tests under ASan + UBSan in build-sanitize/
```

The plugin itself must still be validated in X-Plane 12. Unit tests cover logic and parsing only.

## Architecture

Modules coordinate through X-Plane's XPLM API:

- **`main.cpp`** — Plugin entry points (`XPluginStart`, `XPluginStop`, `XPluginEnable`, `XPluginDisable`). Registers the draw callback that drives the UI.
- **`flight_logger`** — Core data acquisition. Runs every frame sampling aircraft state via X-Plane datarefs. Saves flight data to `<X-Plane>/Output/x_pilot_reports/flights/` as JSON (resolved via `XPLMGetSystemPath`). Handles aircraft profiles for landing quality thresholds.
- **`auto_qnh`** — Monitors altimeter settings, syncs to actual QNH, issues warnings for mismatches, and registers X-Plane commands.
- **`logbook_ui`** — Dear ImGui window displaying flight history from JSON files, with delete/view/regenerate actions.
- **`html_report`** — Parses flight JSON and generates HTML reports in `<X-Plane>/Output/x_pilot_reports/reports/`.

Each module uses a C++ namespace with `init()` and `stop()` lifecycle functions.

**Data locations.** User data (flights, reports, `index.html`, `settings.json`) lives under `<X-Plane>/Output/x_pilot_reports/` so it survives plugin updates. The only bundled, read-only config is `flight_logger_profiles.json`, which stays in the plugin's own `data/` directory. On first start, `flight_logger::init()` migrates any user data left in the old in-plugin `data/` location to Output once (guarded by a `.migrated` marker).

## Key Data Structures

Defined in `html_report.hpp`:

- `TrackPoint` — timestamped lat/lon/altitude/speed/vertical speed sample
- `LandingData` — descent rate, G-force, pitch, wind, quality rating
- `FlightData` — complete flight record (aircraft, airports, block time, track points, landings)

Aircraft landing quality thresholds are configured in `data/flight_logger_profiles.json` by category (ultra_light through heavy_jet), with ICAO-code-based automatic profile selection.

## Build Details

- **CMake 3.21+**, C++17, macOS 12.0+ universal binary (arm64 + x86_64)
- Output is `build/xp_pilot.xpl` (X-Plane plugin binary format)
- Vendor dependencies in `vendor/` and SDK headers in `sdk/` — populated by `make setup`, not committed
- Compiler flags: `-Wall -Wextra -fvisibility=hidden`, OpenGL deprecation warnings suppressed
- The `.xpl` plugin is intentionally not ASan-instrumented — for in-sim memory analysis use Instruments.app against the X-Plane process

## Code Quality

All implementation in this repo must follow clean-code best practices:

- **Single responsibility**: each function does one thing; each module owns one concern.
- **Meaningful names**: variables, functions and types read as plain English — no abbreviations, no cryptic suffixes.
- **Small functions, shallow nesting**: prefer early returns and helpers over deeply nested conditionals.
- **DRY**: extract shared logic rather than copying it; but don't abstract speculatively.
- **Encapsulation**: keep statics/internals private to their translation unit; expose only what the header promises.
- **Separation of concerns**: UI code never touches file I/O directly; data modules never draw.
- **Minimal comments**: let the code explain itself. Add a comment only when the *why* is non-obvious.
- **No speculative generality**: don't build abstractions for hypothetical future needs — match the existing codebase style.
- **Boundaries only for validation**: trust internal code; validate at the edges (user input, external APIs, file parsing).

## Repository Workflow

One repository only: **origin** — `git@github.com:rwellinger/xp_pilot.git` (public, community-visible).

Branch prefixes `feature/` and `fix/` are both allowed; the workflow is identical.

1. Start every piece of work as a branch off `main`: `git checkout -b feature/<name>`
2. Commit and push the branch during development: `git push origin feature/<name>`
3. **Never** merge into `main` locally — code enters `main` only through a PR on GitHub.
4. Open the PR, let it be reviewed, and merge it there.

Rationale: over 3000 users run the plugin and some build it themselves from `main`. Unfinished code on `main` produced broken builds and user complaints before a release was even out.

### Releases

`gh release create <tag> --generate-notes` collects the titles and descriptions of all PRs merged
since the previous tag automatically as release notes.

### Ask before outward-facing steps

Opening a PR, merging it, or cutting a release must never happen on an AI assistant's own
initiative. Always ask the maintainer for explicit confirmation first. Working on a branch —
committing and pushing it — needs no such confirmation.
