## Project

- `codexctl` is a Rust 2024 CLI for managing multiple OpenAI Codex CLI accounts.
- It saves profiles, labels and tells apart accounts, switches accounts, reports rate limits, manages banked resets, launches Codex with account recovery, and runs account-pinned commands.
- `Cargo.toml` is the source of truth for the package version.
- Current release: `v0.1.43`.
- The license is Apache-2.0.

## Map

- `CONTEXT.md` is the domain glossary. Use its terms in code, docs, PRs, and reports.
- `docs/adr/` records architecture decisions.
- `src/main.rs` is the binary entry point.
- `src/lib.rs` is the library entry point.
- `src/commands/` contains CLI command implementations.
- `src/api.rs` contains API code.
- `src/config.rs` and `src/profile.rs` contain configuration and profile code.
- `tests/api_test.rs`, `tests/cli_test.rs`, `tests/config_test.rs`, `tests/exec_test.rs`, and `tests/profile_test.rs` contain tests.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/` contains design specifications.
- `docs/superpowers/plans/` contains implementation runbooks. Use the existing matching plan instead of adding task workflow here.

## Commands

- Check formatting: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- Run Clippy: `cargo clippy --all-targets`
- Run tests: `cargo test --all-targets`
- Build a release binary: `cargo build --release`
- Build a locked target release: `cargo build --release --locked --target <target-triple>`
- Install from GitHub: `cargo install --git https://github.com/Sawmills/codexctl`

## Rules

- Preserve isolated login homes at `~/.codexctl/login-homes/<alias>`.
- Preserve pinned exec homes at `~/.codexctl/exec-homes/<alias>`.
- Run Codex login with `CODEX_HOME=~/.codexctl/login-homes/<alias>`.
- Keep `codexctl use` as a local auth-file swap that does not contact OpenAI.
- Keep `codexctl exec` from changing `~/.codex/auth.json` or the active marker. It can provision its exec home and capture rotated auth back to the saved profile.
- Refuse `codexctl exec` when `CODEX_HOME` is already set. A pinned launch must not replace an inherited Codex home without saying so.
- Identify an account by its workspace and its login together. Neither identifies it alone: a workspace holds many logins, and a login holds seats in many workspaces.
- Keep every login claim a token makes. A token gaining `chatgpt_user_id` is the ordinary legacy-to-current transition, and collapsing to one preferred claim makes the same seat look like two people.
- Compare logins only inside one namespace. `uid:` and `sub:` are unrelated facts, so they must never match by coincidence and never prove a difference either.
- Read a profile's identity from its stored token first and its metadata second, and keep what has been proven when a captured file omits it.
- Require positive agreement before `login` or `save` replaces stored credentials. "Cannot confirm" is not "yes".
- Treat silence from an unreadable profile as absence of evidence, never as a matching claim. Two sides declaring nothing agree only when both can actually be read.
- Separate a conflict that is proven from one that is merely unprovable. Refuse claims that positively disagree; no flag may override that. Where neither side declares enough to compare, ask the operator: prompt on a terminal, refuse without one unless `--allow-adopt` is set.
- Do not make `remove` the only remedy for a profile the store cannot identify. Deleting the evidence and replacing it unchecked is weaker than the replacement it guards.
- Capture a token back to the alias the caller named. Fall back to token inspection only when the file does not belong to that alias.
- Let an exact access token decide ownership on its own; anything rotated needs the claims to agree. Resolve undecidable ownership to no owner rather than a guess.
- Weigh every holder of an exact token together, not one at a time. A lone holder owns it unless both sides name a workspace and the two differ. Among several, the holder naming the arriving workspace owns it; failing that, and only where the arriving token names a workspace of its own, every holder naming some other one means none of them is this account and the seat is free to record. Anything else leaves ownership undecided — a claimless holder beside a contradicting one, or an arriving token naming no workspace to compare against holders that do — and undecided refuses another copy rather than adding one.
- Keep one account in one profile. The account identifies the profile; the alias is only the name reached for, and a mistyped one is free by definition. `login` lands on the profile that already holds the arriving account whatever alias was typed, because the browser login has already happened and refusing would discard it. `save` refuses and names that alias instead, having nothing to lose by asking.
- Pass the pinned alias to children in `CODEXCTL_PINNED_ALIAS`. Recovery must exclude the account a pinned launch already selected.
- Order captured tokens by issued-at and fall back to expiry. Never overwrite a saved token with an older copy of the same seat.
- Pin a launch with `CODEX_HOME=~/.codexctl/exec-homes/<alias>`. Seed `auth.json` as a real file and share every other `~/.codex` entry by symbolic link. Never replace an entry that already exists, so an entry Codex turned into a real file stays as it left it until the home is deleted.
- Never auto-select usage-based accounts during recovery.
- Require confirmation before a switch can bill credits. Refuse that switch on a non-interactive terminal unless `--allow-billing` is set.
- Keep reset approval separate from billing approval. `--allow-billing` must not imply `--allow-resets`.
- Never redeem a banked reset before its account has an exhausted window.
- Spend the qualifying banked reset closest to expiry.
- Keep explicit alias selection from redeeming a reset.
- Preserve the current working directory when `codexctl codex` or `codexctl exec` launches a child.
