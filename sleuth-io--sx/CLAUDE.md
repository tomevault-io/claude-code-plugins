```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

# sx - Coding Agent Guide

Your team's private npm for AI assets - skills, MCP configs, commands, and more.

## Quick Commands

```bash
make build          # Build binary to ./dist/sx
make test           # Run tests
make format         # Format code
make lint           # Run linter
make prepush        # Format + lint + test + build (run before claiming done)
```

## Before Reporting Work Complete

**ALWAYS run `make prepush` before claiming a task is finished.** CI runs
format, lint, tests, and build — if any of those fail locally, don't
tell the user the work is done.

## Testing Local Changes

After making code changes, build and test with:

```bash
make build && ./dist/sx <command>
```

## Development

- Format: `gofmt`
- Lint: `golangci-lint`
- Tests must pass with race detection
- **Keep the commit subject line ≤ 72 characters** (the `pr-check/sleuth`
  status enforces this maximum subject length and blocks the PR when it is
  longer). Put detail in the body, not the subject.
- Keep code comments to the density of the surrounding code. Design rationale,
  cross-client comparisons, and rejected alternatives belong in the PR
  description, not hanging off a `const` or a one-line helper.
- **NEVER run `git push` without explicit user permission**

## Releases

Tag and push to trigger automated release:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

GoReleaser builds for Linux/macOS/Windows and auto-generates changelog.
