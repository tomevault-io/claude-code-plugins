## What this is

ruNNtime runs neural networks on the user's own GPU through WebGPU. It is
TypeScript on [TypeGPU](https://docs.swmansion.com/TypeGPU/): kernels are
TypeGPU code compiled to WGSL at build time, models are composed from those
kernels in plain TypeScript. No ONNX, no WASM, no export step. Published to
npm as `runntime`, documented at
[docs.swmansion.com/runntime](https://docs.swmansion.com/runntime).

pnpm monorepo, Node 22 or newer:

- `packages/runntime`: the library. `src/zoo` is what users call, one
  `create<Task>()` runner per task and the Hub weight registry in `models.ts`.
  `src/zoo/transformers` is the transformers.js plugin, one loader per model.
  `src/core` is the engine (graph ops, kernels, dispatch, buffer pool, weight
  loading). Only `runntime/zoo` and `runntime/zoo/transformers` are published.
- `apps/docs`: the Starlight docs site, the only user-facing documentation.
  See `apps/docs/AGENTS.md` before working there.
- `scripts/sync-readme.mjs`: copies the root `README.md` into the package on
  prepack. Edit the root file, the package copy is generated and gitignored.

There is no test suite in this repo. Verification is typecheck, lint and the
docs build.

## Why it is built this way

- Ops never touch the GPU. `matmul(a, b)` validates shapes and returns a
  pending `Value`. `toArray` / `evalValues` walk the graph, encode every
  dispatch into one pass and submit once.
- Pipelines are keyed by op, dtype and load-time config, never by input
  shape. Runtime-variable dims travel in uniforms, so a new input length never
  compiles a shader.
- Intermediate buffers come from the executor's pool and go back when their
  last consumer is dispatched. Uploads made with `tensor()` or `uploadF32`
  are outside the pool and must be destroyed by whoever made them.
- One `gpuExecutor` per model, created once. Pooled buffers and memoized bind
  groups only pay off across calls.
- The user's `tgpu.init` (and the plugin's `initRunntimeBackend`) requests
  `subgroups` and `shader-f16` as optional features. Without `subgroups` the
  fast small-m matmul and attention routes are gone, without `shader-f16` the
  conv-based tasks refuse to load. Code checks `device.features` before using
  either.
- Dispatch count is the cost model. Elementwise ops fuse into their consumer,
  matmul carries bias, activation and addend in its epilogue, decode runs
  bursts of tokens per submit and readback rides the same submit. A new op
  goes into an existing kernel's epilogue before it gets its own dispatch.
- Task runners serialize calls on a promise queue and free their GPU
  resources in `dispose()`.

## How to build and verify

- `pnpm install` installs deps and the Git hooks (Lefthook: Prettier and
  ESLint on staged files, `tsc` on the library, commitlint on the message).
- `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format`.
- `pnpm --filter runntime build`: tsdown, output in `dist`. Kernel files carry
  `'use gpu'` and `unplugin-typegpu` embeds their WGSL, so consumers need no
  build plugin. `typegpu`, `@huggingface/transformers` and `js-tiktoken` stay
  external.
- `pnpm dev:docs` / `pnpm build:docs`. The docs and their live demos import
  `runntime/zoo` from the library's `dist`, so build the library first or run
  `pnpm --filter docs... run build`. The docs dev server does not watch the
  library: after editing `packages/runntime/src`, rebuild it.
- Docs code samples are ` ```ts twoslash `: the docs build type-checks
  them against the built library and fails on an error. Setup the reader does
  not need (`declare const canvas: HTMLCanvasElement;`) goes above
  `// ---cut---`. The API reference under `/api/` is generated from the
  exports and their doc comments by `starlight-typedoc`; do not edit it.
- Dependency changes go through `pnpm add` / `pnpm install` so `pnpm-lock.yaml`
  follows. CI installs with `--frozen-lockfile` and fails on a stale lockfile.
- Commits follow Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`,
  `docs`, `chore`, scopes `core`, `zoo`, `docs`), header up to 120
  characters. CI runs the docs build on every pull request that touches
  `apps/docs` or `packages/runntime`. The npm publish is a manual workflow.
- The docs site is published from the `docs` branch, not from `main`. Work
  lands on `main`; merging `main` into `docs` deploys it to Pages, usually
  right after an npm release. A fix for the live site goes in a pull request
  against `docs`, then `docs` is merged back into `main`. Both of these merges
  use a merge commit, never squash, or the two branches drift apart.
- Benchmark numbers on the docs pages come from measured runs. Never edit or
  derive one by hand.
