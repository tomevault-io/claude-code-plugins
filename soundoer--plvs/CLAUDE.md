# AGENTS.md — PLVS

PLVS is a real-time audio metering desktop app: Tauri 2 + Rust backend, React 19 + Vite frontend.
This file records only what an agent cannot infer from the code. Details live in `docs/`.

| Topic                                        | Where                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Architecture, audio pipeline, IPC, theming   | `docs/architecture.md`         |
| Engineering traps and incident context       | `docs/pitfalls.md`             |
| User guide (source of the website docs page) | `docs/user/`                   |
| Agent Control CLI commands and JSON contract | `docs/user/cli.md`             |
| Agent Control implementation contract        | `docs/agent-control/README.md` |
| Product scope and boundaries                 | `docs/prd.md`                  |
| Design tokens                                | `docs/design-tokens.md`        |
| Architecture decisions                       | `docs/adr/`                    |
| Local dev, CI, versioning                    | `CONTRIBUTING.md`              |
| How the documentation itself is organised    | `docs/README.md`               |

When the docs and the code disagree, **the code on `main` wins**.

Add a pitfall here only when code cannot reveal it, automation cannot reliably prevent it, and the
failure cost is high. Keep the entry to an actionable summary and put investigation history in
`docs/pitfalls.md`.

## Commands

| Command                                | Purpose                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run desktop`                      | Run the real app (Tauri). Audio capture only works here.                          |
| `npm run desktop:control -- <command>` | Build and run the dev-identity CLI against a running development app.             |
| `npm run dev`                          | Vite only, in a browser. No Tauri APIs, no audio capture.                         |
| `npm run check`                        | The merge gate: version + format + lint + typecheck + test + build + Rust checks. |
| `npm run typecheck`                    | `tsc` over `src/` (checkJs, JSDoc types). Zero errors, no baseline.               |
| `npm test`                             | Vitest, single run.                                                               |
| `npm run smoke:capture`                | Real capture smoke test. Needs VB-Cable + VLC on the machine.                     |
| `npm run smoke:agent-control`          | Real Agent Control screenshot/recording smoke. Needs the development GUI running. |
| `npm run soak:capture`                 | Long-running capture soak, 4 hours by default.                                    |
| `npm run docs:site`                    | Render `docs/user/` into `landing/docs/index.html` to preview the website docs.   |

## Agent Control

Agent Control is the supported way for agents and automation to inspect or change the state visible
in a running PLVS window. Windows uses a current-user named pipe; macOS uses a private Unix socket.

- Start the development GUI with `npm run desktop`, then use a second terminal for commands such as
  `npm run desktop:control -- inspect --json`. The wrapper builds `plvs-cli` with `dev-identity` and
  targets only the development app; it neither starts the GUI nor controls an installed release.
- Discover the live surface with `capabilities`, then `inspect` and retain its global revision.
  Mutations require `--expected-revision`; after a conflict, inspect and reconcile instead of
  retrying blindly. Use `--dry-run` where the command supports it.
- Live mutations must pass through the running React application's existing business functions,
  safety guards, native integrations, and persistence paths. Do not mutate stores or native state
  directly to add a CLI shortcut.
- When extending Agent Control, follow the synchronization checklist in
  `docs/agent-control/README.md` and update the schema, read/patch mapping, documentation, capability
  declaration, and contract tests that cover the changed surface. Never hand-edit
  `docs/agent-control/generated/`.

## Project structure

Only the directories that carry rules are listed; the rest of the tree speaks for itself. What you must not do with them is under Boundaries.

- `src/ipc/` — the frontend's boundary to the Rust audio engine.
- `src/persistence/` — split into domains (see Known pitfalls).
- `src-tauri/src/audio/`, `dsp/`, `engine/` — the capture layer (see Testing).
- `src/generated/` — generated by `npm run theme:generate`, which prebuild runs for you.
- `.agents/skills/` — repository-scoped agent skills, discovered automatically from anywhere in this repository.
- `docs/history/` — historical working records (see Documentation).

## Documentation

Documents are grouped by shelf life, not by subject. `docs/README.md` explains the groups; these are
the rules that bind you.

**New specs and plans go to `docs/history/`**, overriding any skill that names another path:

- spec → `docs/history/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- plan → `docs/history/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md`
- anything else one-off (investigation, spike, roadmap, audit) → `docs/history/notes/`

`docs/superpowers/` and `docs/working/` no longer exist and must not be recreated; a test fails if
they are.

**Records under `docs/history/` are historical, not living documentation.** You may refine a record
while its design, review or implementation work is active. Do not edit an older record merely to
make it match the current product, mark later implementation status or rewrite a superseded
decision. Put materially changed direction in a new dated record. Whether a feature shipped is
answered by git history and `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Living documents must never link into `docs/history/`**, and a record there is never the source of
current behaviour. If some current behaviour is described only in a historical record, move the durable
part into `docs/architecture.md` (what it is) or a new ADR (why it has to stay that way), then link
that. Source comments may cite a record as evidence ("measured in …"), because they are versioned
with the code beside them.

**A change to user-visible behaviour updates the matching `docs/user/` chapter in the same
commit.** The user guide is the single source for how PLVS behaves; the website renders it and is
deployed only when a version is released, so writing it early publishes nothing. The `README.md`
highlights, the landing page and its screenshots are summaries, reconciled at release by
`.agents/skills/plvs-release` Step 4b. `docs/prd.md` states intent and boundaries; a new capability reaches
it only when it changes a promise or a non-goal.

Facts the code owns — panels, auto-detected layouts, the macOS minimum version, release package
names, `plvs-cli` commands — are checked against the code by `scripts/documentationStructure.test.js`.
Extend those checks instead of adding tests that assert sentences.

Write an ADR when someone could look at the code and reasonably ask "why not just do the obvious
simpler thing?". ADRs are never edited; a changed decision gets a new ADR that supersedes the old.

## Code style

Documentation, comments, commit messages and PRs are in English. String literals that must match localized OS/UI text are the exception.
Line endings are LF (`.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`). Formatting and lint are enforced by `npm run check` — no need to memorize the rules.
UI-visible labels across PLVS default to Title Case unless there's a specific reason not to, e.g. `Max Hold`, `Channel Pair`; `aria-label`s stay lowercase — a separate, non-user-facing convention.

## Testing

Tests sit next to the source file they cover, named `*.test.js` / `*.test.jsx` (Vitest). Rust tests run via `npm run rust:test`.

**The capture layer is not covered by CI.** After changing `src-tauri/src/audio`, `dsp` or `engine`: neither `npm run check` nor CI touches that code, because the runners have no sound card. A bug there ships with an all-green board.

`release:preflight` runs `npm run smoke:capture` when capture-smoke dependencies changed and will
stop the release. It has no bypass flag, deliberately: a gate you can wave through is not a gate.
Fixing it means fixing the harness build or the rig — VB-Cable + VLC on the machine.

After capture-layer work, remind the user to run `npm run soak:capture` (4 hours by default). It is the only thing that surfaces leaks and metric drift, it does not gate releases, and it will therefore never run unless someone asks for it. Complete runs are kept in `artifacts/soak/` as the baseline: read a new run's drift against the spread of those runs, recomputed from the files, not only against the script's 0.01 dB limit — a value well under the limit but far outside the usual spread still deserves a look. Treat a red soak as a lead, not a verdict.

## Git workflow

**Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), scope included:
`fix(cli): ...`.** Nothing lints this, but `.agents/skills/plvs-release` reads the types to pick the SemVer
bump and group the CHANGELOG, so an unprefixed commit silently drops out of the release notes.

The version must match in three places: `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. `npm run version:check` verifies this.

**Worktrees and branches.** Big features get an isolated worktree, one per feature, under an agent-specific prefix: `.claude/worktrees/<feature-name>` for Claude Code, `.codex/worktrees/<feature-name>` for Codex, `.cursor/worktrees/<feature-name>` for Cursor. Don't reuse one fixed worktree across features — that just relocates the same cleanup problem instead of avoiding it. When a feature merges or is dropped, clean up right away: `git worktree remove` plus deleting the branch (`-d` once merged, `-D` for unmerged only after confirming with the user), and `git push origin --delete` for any merged remote branch. Skip `archive/`-prefixed branches by default. Branches parked for a dependency reason (e.g. Dependabot's `deps/*`) — confirm the reason still holds before deleting.

## Boundaries

The one place rules are stated as rules. Each entry says what, not why; the why is in the section that owns the subject.

**Never**

- Edit anything under `src/generated/` or `docs/agent-control/generated/` by hand.
- Route around a red `smoke:capture`.
- Reach the audio engine from a component. All engine traffic (invoke / Channel / Event) goes through `src/ipc/`. This covers the audio engine only — window, tray, always-on-top and autostart call `@tauri-apps/api` straight from their hooks by design. Do not "fix" them.
- Allocate, lock, or syscall on the audio callback thread. See realtime-safe under Key terms in `docs/architecture.md` when touching `src-tauri/src/audio` or `dsp`.

**Ask first**

- Moving work off `main`. Work lands on `main` by default and history stays linear, so ignore any generic "never commit to the default branch" habit here. If you judge that a change needs isolating, say so and let the user decide — do not branch silently. Branching here often means a worktree under `.claude/worktrees/`, not switching the checkout in place.
- Capture smoke is red and you cannot fix the rig.

**Always**

- Run `npm run check` before merging.
- Register every new editor with draft / preview / save / cancel semantics as a blocking editor
  (`useBlockingEditor`), and cover it with tests that the scene operations are refused and that
  nothing was mutated before the refusal. See Known pitfalls.

## Known pitfalls

Read the relevant section of `docs/pitfalls.md` before touching these areas. The short
rules below are the working set; the incident history and rationale live there.

- **Tests and tooling:** Vitest also guards Tauri and installer files. React or persistence tests
  need `/** @vitest-environment jsdom */`; jest-dom matchers are unavailable. A fresh worktree needs
  `npm run ffmpeg:fetch` before the Rust build.
- **Module boundaries:** logic-only code imports `workspace/moduleCatalog.js`, never
  `workspace/registry.jsx`.
- **Windows and dock geometry:** frontend CSS lengths crossing into Rust use the frontend-provided
  `webviewScale`; persisted geometry remains physical pixels; apply chrome before geometry.
- **Capture rig:** verify the `device-enumeration` check from `plvs-cli doctor --json`. In detached
  RDP, expose remote machine audio, start the player after detaching, and reject runs whose loudness
  remains `null`. Build the current feature-gated `capture-harness` binary (`--profile harness`,
  `target/harness/`) when smoke or soak reports exit 2.
- **Scene editors:** blocking is based on an editor being open, not dirty. Guard scene operations in
  the business function before mutation; never discard a draft to make an operation proceed.
- **Analysis history:** changing a request key creates a history slab. Key-changing sliders commit
  on release, retention comes from `deriveRetainedAnalysisKeys`, and eviction targets every
  ingesting intake. Use exactly representable Float32 values in exact-equality fixtures.
- **Dock presets:** a dock-disabled preset deliberately does not restore the strip layout stored in
  its snapshot.
- **Rendering changes:** visual sizes are CSS px (`docs/architecture.md`, "Screen-space sizes").
  Verify any change to how a panel renders by comparing Agent Control screenshot pixels before and
  after; tests see neither compositing nor line weight.
- **Persistence:** choose the domain in `src/persistence/index.js`; external writers must notify the
  owning React state. `plvs-settings.json` is the shared store and must not be casually renamed.
  During desktop development, never validate persistence across a Vite reload—restart the app and
  inspect the file. Do not refresh the boot snapshot from `on_page_load`.
