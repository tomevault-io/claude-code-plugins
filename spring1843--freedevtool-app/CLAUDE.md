# FreeDevTool.App – Copilot Coding Agent Onboarding

## Purpose

- Help agents contribute safely and efficiently with minimal friction and green CI.
- Keep changes clean, small, and aligned with project standards.

## What this app is

- FreeDevTool.App is a stand-alone web app offering developer/productivity utilities.
- No network calls after load; treat it as an offline SPA. Do not add telemetry or remote calls.
- Built with Vite. There is no backend aside from rendering the initially rendering the page by Vite.
- See `README.md` for details.

## How to build, test, and verify locally

- Fresh setup: `make deps`
- Build for production: `make build`
- Full CI checks (lint, typecheck, tests, build, etc.): `make ci`
- Always ensure `make ci` passes before proposing changes.

## Project layout hints

- `Makefile` contains all commands for install, build, lint, tests, and CI checks. Do not add raw shell in workflows; add/update Makefile targets instead.
- The app is packaged via `make build`. Production readiness checks run via `make ci`.
- Review docs first: `README.md`, `STYLE.md`, `Makefile`, and other docs.

## Coding guidelines

- Follow `STYLE.md` strictly (naming, formatting, folder structure, imports, testing approach).
- Prefer small, focused PRs. Keep diffs minimal and avoid churn.
- Reuse existing utilities/components/hooks. Do not duplicate logic; refactor shared code where helpful.
- Maintain strong typing and avoid `any`. Add/adjust types as needed.
- Keep components simple, composable, and accessible. Avoid hidden side-effects.
- Respect the app’s offline constraint. Do not introduce network I/O or background syncing.
- Keep browser compatibility aligned with existing tooling and configs.

## Dependencies

- Minimize new dependencies. Justify additions clearly and prefer lightweight, well-maintained packages.
- Use `make deps` to manage installs. If adding a dep, ensure lockfiles are updated and CI remains green.
- Avoid adding tooling that duplicates what the `Makefile`/CI already covers.

## Testing and quality

- Run `make ci` locally before proposing changes.
- Add/maintain tests when changing logic. Keep coverage consistent with repo standards.
- Fix lint/type errors rather than suppressing. If suppression is necessary, keep it scoped and documented.

## Performance and UX

- Avoid unnecessary re-renders and heavy runtime work.
- Defer non-critical work and keep bundles lean. Prefer code-splitting where it makes sense.
- Maintain consistent styling and theming. Follow existing design system and components.

## Security and privacy

- No outbound requests. Do not introduce analytics, CDNs for runtime data, or feature flags that call home.
- Validate and sanitize user inputs where relevant within the app’s utilities.

## PR readiness checklist (pre-submit)

- Code adheres to `STYLE.md` and the tenets section in `README.md`.
- `make ci` passes locally.
- No hard-coded paths, secrets, or environment assumptions.
- Only `Makefile` commands are used in docs/scripts; no raw bash in the .github/workflows directory.
- Changes are minimal, reversible, and documented in code comments where non-obvious.

## First steps for a new task

- Inventory the codebase and read: `README.md`, `STYLE.md`, and any related docs in the feature area.
- Identify existing components/utilities to reuse.
- Plan the minimal change set needed to meet goals while keeping CI green.
- Implement, test locally via `make ci`, and prepare a concise PR.

## Contact points

- Refer to repo docs and issues for conventions and decisions. If ambiguity exists, align with `STYLE.md` and existing patterns.
