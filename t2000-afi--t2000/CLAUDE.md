# design-system

> t2000 design system — design-tokens/tokens.css is the copy-in SSOT for values; shadcn primitives owned per-app; near-black house theme + per-app accent; never reintroduce @t2000/ui. Full model in .claude/skills/t2000-design-system/.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/design-system/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Design System → `.claude/skills/t2000-design-system/SKILL.md`

**The model in one line:** share VALUES by copy-in (`design-tokens/tokens.css`,
pure CSS variables only), own COMPONENTS per-app (shadcn in `components/ui/`), and
never ship a shared UI/token package again — `@t2000/ui` was removed 2026-07-01
because it bundled a marketing global stylesheet and packaged primitives a
consumer's Tailwind can't scan.

House look is the seamless near-black dark theme (`--bg #08090a`); the one per-app
knob is `--t2k-accent`. Read semantic tokens (`--bg`/`--bg-elevated`/`--border`),
never the raw `--ds-gray-*` palette, and never hardcode hex outside `tokens.css`.

**Read the full model — adoption table, theme values, and the five rules — before
styling any app:** `.claude/skills/t2000-design-system/SKILL.md`.
