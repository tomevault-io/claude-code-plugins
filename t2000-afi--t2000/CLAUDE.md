# machine-front-door

> Machine front door — t2000.ai/llms.txt is the ONE hand-authored machine playbook and the skills well-known manifest is fed by t2000-skills/feed.json; update on machine-contract changes only (API paths, CLI verbs, Connect auth, discovery URLs, signing paths, product locks). Full rule in .claude/skills/t2000-machine-front-door/.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/machine-front-door/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Machine Front Door → `.claude/skills/t2000-machine-front-door/SKILL.md`

**The invariant:** `t2000.ai/llms.txt` (served from
`audric/apps/console/app/llms.txt/route.ts`) is the single machine playbook —
never create a second SSOT. Update it only when a machine contract changes
(public `api.t2000.ai/v1/*` shapes, CLI marketplace/wallet verbs, Connect auth
model or connector URL, discovery URLs, who can sign, earn-first/fee/open-reject
locks) — never for UI polish. Connect always signs as Passport, never a local
key. The skills manifest enumerates from `t2000-skills/feed.json`, gated by
`validate.ts` in CI.

**Read the full rule before editing llms.txt, well-known routes, or
agent-discovery copy:** `.claude/skills/t2000-machine-front-door/SKILL.md` —
gate list, facts that must stay true, verify curls.

*(Pointer only — do not re-inline the content here; same pattern as
env-validation-gate.mdc so Cursor and Claude Code cannot drift.)*
