# engineering-discipline

> Core engineering discipline — trace before fix, verifiable goals, simplicity, complete removal, Musk algorithm. The always-on assertions; depth lives in .claude/skills/t2000-engineering/.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/engineering-discipline/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Engineering Discipline

> **Canonical depth: `.claude/skills/t2000-engineering/SKILL.md`.** That file holds

> trap, and the test-file convention. This block is the always-on summary and is
> intentionally mirrored in `CLAUDE.md § Engineering Discipline` — those two copies
> must stay in sync; everything else lives in the skill only.

**Trace before you fix.** Trace the ACTUAL execution path (user action → route →
handler → SDK → chain → response → UI) and confirm which code actually runs before
changing anything. Most multi-iteration fixes are one-iteration fixes that started
in the wrong layer.

**Verifiable goals, always.** Convert every task into a goal with a runnable check.
State multi-step plans as `step → verify:` pairs. Never say "done" without running
the verify step; never "should be fine" without re-reading the diff.

**Single source of truth.** If data exists somewhere, import it. Never copy a token
map, decimal, coin type, or config into a second file. Before hardcoding any list,
ask whether someone will have to hand-update it later — if yes, the approach is wrong.

**Fix at the root.** If a fix needs 3+ places or several attempts, the architecture
is wrong. Find the single point of failure.

**Simplicity first, surgically applied.** Minimum code that solves the problem;
nothing speculative. No abstractions for single-use code — and none whose *shape* is
shared but whose *logic* isn't. Touch only what the request requires; match existing
style; mention unrelated dead code rather than deleting it.

**Remove completely — no orphans.** When you delete a feature, sweep every layer in
the same pass: source, types, error codes, tests, deps, patches, docs, rules, CI,
export barrels, empty dirs. Dead remnants of your own removal are in scope; "keep it
just in case" is not.

**Run the product algorithm in order.** (1) Make the requirements less dumb —
requirements are guilty until proven innocent. (2) Delete the part or step; if you
aren't adding back ≥10%, you didn't delete enough. (3) Optimize what survived.
(4) Accelerate. (5) Automate last. Default to deletion; name the fork rather than
silently picking a constrained path.

**Machines AND humans.** Every surface must work for an autonomous agent *and* a
person. If a design serves only one, it's half-built.
