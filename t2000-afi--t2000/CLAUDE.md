# env-validation-gate

> Env validation gate — every app with ≥1 required env var validates its contract at boot via Zod; raw process.env is banned outside the env module. Full pattern in .claude/skills/t2000-env-gate/.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/env-validation-gate/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Env Validation Gate → `.claude/skills/t2000-env-gate/SKILL.md`

**The invariant:** every app with ≥1 REQUIRED env var validates at boot via a Zod
schema and exposes values through a typed `env` proxy. Raw `process.env.X` reads
outside the env module are banned (only `NODE_ENV` and `NEXT_RUNTIME` are exempt),
and `process.env.X || 'default'` is banned outright — it masks a misconfig forever.
Apps with ZERO required vars may validate inline instead.

Why: an empty-string var in the Vercel UI silently degraded production for ~4 days
and surfaced three layers below the actual cause.

**Read the full pattern before editing any env code:**
`.claude/skills/t2000-env-gate/SKILL.md` — the Zod schema shape, the client/server
split, the boot hook, and the reference implementation at
`audric/apps/web-v3/lib/env.ts`.
