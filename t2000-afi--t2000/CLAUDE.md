# financial-amounts

> Financial amount + token data safety — floor display amounts (never round up), decimals come from the SDK token registry. Full detail in .claude/skills/t2000-financial-amounts/.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/financial-amounts/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Financial Amounts → `.claude/skills/t2000-financial-amounts/SKILL.md`

**The invariants:**

1. **Floor, never round.** Any amount shown to a user or passed to an SDK builder
   must be **≤** the actual on-chain balance. `Math.round` can round up and produce
   more raw units than the user holds → "Insufficient balance".
2. **Decimals are registry data, never call-site literals.** Read them from
   `COIN_REGISTRY` / `SUPPORTED_ASSETS` in `packages/sdk/src/token-registry.ts` +
   `constants.ts`. Never create a second token map.

**Read the full detail before touching amount math or token metadata:**
`.claude/skills/t2000-financial-amounts/SKILL.md` — per-token display precision,
chip/preset math for tiny balances, and the canonical-source table.

cannot drift.)*
