# sui-platform

> Sui platform patterns — Address Balances (SIP-58) make one address concurrent, gasless stablecoin transfers remove the SUI-for-gas wall, plus the eligibility gotchas that cause misleading failures. Full detail in .claude/skills/t2000-sui-platform/.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/sui-platform/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

**The two things people get wrong:**

1. **"One Sui address can only do one tx at a time" is a myth** for a server payer.
   Address Balances (SIP-58) turn fungible holdings into an accumulator (no
   owned-object lock) and address-balance gas removes the gas-coin contention →
   **a single settlement address scales.** A wallet fleet is a blast-radius lever,
   never a scaling prerequisite.
2. **"Gasless" is narrower than it sounds.** Only pure stablecoin transfers on the
   allowlisted trio qualify — any custom Move call still needs gas. Plus: 0.01
   minimum, a dust-remainder floor that surfaces as a misleading "insufficient SUI
   balance" error, and auto-detect that only works on gRPC/GraphQL transports.

**Read the full gotcha list before architecting a payer or debugging a send:**
