# spend-lanes

> Spend lanes — Cursor for review/specs, Claude Code for all implementation. Stops frontier token burn on multi-file code work in Cursor.

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/spend-lanes/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Spend lanes (founder 2026-07-24, revised)

Burning Cursor frontier tokens (especially `claude-fable-*-thinking-high`) on
implementation is the failure mode this rule stops. Founder pays Cursor Max +
Anthropic Max; **all multi-file code work goes to Claude Code on the Max
subscription** (browser OAuth login — never an Anthropic API key in Cursor).

## The two lanes

| Lane | Tool | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| **Think / Review** | This Cursor chat (default = Auto; Fable only for hard architecture or debugging) | Specs, plans, diff review, acceptance criteria, handoff prompts |
| **Build** | Claude Code (`claude`) on Anthropic Max | Features, refactors, multi-file implementation, long agentic loops, mechanical sweeps |

## What this chat MUST do

When the user asks for code / implementation / "build X" / "fix the tests":

1. Write a short plan + **acceptance criteria** (verifiable).
2. Emit a **paste-ready Claude Code prompt** (Build lane).
3. **Stop.** Do not open a large edit loop in Cursor.

Exceptions (OK to implement here): single-file typo, one-line config, or the user
explicitly says "do it in this chat."

## What this chat MUST NOT do

- Multi-hour agentic coding sessions in Cursor on Fable / thinking-high.
- Re-open or continue a months-long mega-thread for a new task — **one task = one chat**.
- Put an Anthropic API key into Cursor "to use Max" — Max does not cover API keys.

## Where the rules actually live (2026-07-24 migration)

Claude Code is now the canonical agent surface. `.claude/` owns the content:

- `CLAUDE.md` — auto-loaded every turn (architecture, critical rules, release process)
- `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` — subsystem depth, auto-loaded on task match
- `.claude/commands/*.md` — the repeatable rituals (`/release`, `/ship`, `/tracker`)

Files in `.cursor/rules/` are **pointers into `.claude/`**, not copies — so the two
tools cannot drift. When a rule needs updating, edit the `.claude/` file. The one
deliberate exception is `engineering-discipline.mdc`, which mirrors the short
always-on block from `CLAUDE.md` because Cursor does not read `CLAUDE.md`.

## After Build finishes

Review the diff (`git diff`). Commits stay on the normal review path — do not tell
Claude Code to push blindly.
