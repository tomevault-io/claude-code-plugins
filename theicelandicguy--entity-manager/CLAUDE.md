## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/entity-manager/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

# AGENTS.md — Entity Manager

Home Assistant custom integration, domain `entity_manager`, **v3.6.0**.
Repo `TheIcelandicguy/entity-manager`; source at `E:\entity-manager`.

An admin-only sidebar panel ("Entity Manager", `mdi:tune`) for viewing, enabling,
disabling, renaming, auditing and bulk-managing every entity across every
integration, plus device/area/label assignment and firmware updates. Built for
large installs. No Python requirements; `integration_type: service`,
`iot_class: calculated`, `config_flow: true`, `dependencies: ["frontend"]`,
minimum HA 2024.1.0.

`OVERVIEW.md` in this repo is current and was verified against source — use it
when you need more depth than this file. The unverified root docs that used to
sit beside it (STRUCTURE.md, PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, QUICKSTART.md, DEVREF.md,
INSTALL.md, cursorrules.md) were deleted on 2026-09-22; README.md covers
installation, and git history has the rest.

Before ending a session, run `python check_docs.py` and update this file.
The script checks CLAUDE.md for stale paths, constants, line counts, test counts
and services. Keep this guide aligned with it and validate both when editing.

## Layout

All paths below are relative to the repo root. Note that `tests/` lives at the
**root**, not inside the component directory.

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `custom_components/entity_manager/__init__.py` | 132 lines. Registers the static path `/api/entity_manager/frontend` (served with long cache headers), the WS API, voice intents, the two services, and the sidebar panel (`require_admin=True`), and installs the voice sentences
(`async_install_sentences`). The panel JS `?v=` key is `<manifest version>-<first 10 hex of the file's SHA-256>`, so any redeploy that changes the panel reaches browsers and Companion apps after an HA restart, even without a version bump. |
| `.../const.py` | `DOMAIN`, `MAX_BULK_ENTITIES = 500`, `VALID_ENTITY_ID = ^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*\.[a-z0-9_]+$`. No VERSION constant — the version lives only in `manifest.json` and `package.json`. |
| `.../websocket_api.py` | 1,985 lines. All 24 WS handlers, `async_setup_ws_api()`, and the `enable_entity()` / `disable_entity()` helpers the services reuse. |
| `.../voice_assistant.py` | Enable/Disable intent handlers and `resolve_voice_target()`, which turns what was said into an entity ID. It returns a `VoiceResolution` (entity, how it matched, the other candidates, the near misses); `_resolve_entity_id` is the thin wrapper the intents use, so the panel and intents share entity matching; routing and pipeline execution are separate checks. |
| `.../voice_sentences.py` | 168 lines. Installing the sentence files into `<config>/custom_sentences/<lang>/` and reporting on them (`sentence_status`). Kept out of `__init__` because `websocket_api` reads the same files and cannot import `__init__` without a cycle. |
| `.../sentences/en/entity_manager.yaml` | Voice sentences, copied into `<config>/custom_sentences/en/` at startup. Inside the component, because only that directory is deployed. |
| `.../config_flow.py` | Single step, unique-ID guarded, no options flow. |
| `.../frontend/entity-manager-panel.js` | 19,197 lines. The whole UI as one `EntityManagerPanel extends HTMLElement`. |
| `.../frontend/entity-manager-panel.css` | 7,989 lines, all `--em-*` variables. |
| `tests/` | Python tests: `test_const.py`, `test_websocket_api.py`, `test_voice_assistant.py`, `conftest.py`. |
| `.../frontend/tests/` | Vitest specs + `vitest.setup.js`. |
| `deploy.ps1` | Thin wrapper over `E:\tools\deploy-to-ha.ps1` (see Deploy). No `sync-to-ha.ps1` helper is checked in; that old name is still used locally on this machine only. |
| `check_docs.py` | Verifies this file against the repo. Run it before ending a session. |
| `ruff.toml` | Pins Ruff lint rules for this repo so CI does not inherit widened future defaults. |

## Architecture

```
entity-manager-panel.js  --this.hass.callWS-->  websocket_api.py  -->  HA registries
```

- The panel talks to the backend **only** over HA's WebSocket bus. There is no
  HTTP view and no REST endpoint.
- All 24 commands are named `entity_manager/<name>` and carry **both**
  `@websocket_api.require_admin` and `@websocket_api.async_response` (24/24 in
  source). The panel itself is `require_admin=True`. Every command reads or
  writes registry data, so a handler missing either decorator is a security hole.
- `async_setup_ws_api()` is the single registration point. A handler that isn't
  registered there silently does not exist.
- Registry writes happen in `websocket_api.py` (`er.async_get` / `dr.async_get`)
  and in `voice_assistant.py`. Nowhere else.
- The frontend uses **native** HA WS APIs for anything HA already exposes:
  `config/{area,floor,device,entity,label}_registry/list|update`,
  `history/history_during_period`, `homeassistant/expose_entity[/list]`,
  `assist_pipeline/pipeline/list`, and services like `update.install` /
  `button.press`. Custom `entity_manager/*` commands are reserved for what HA
  does not expose cleanly — the grouped entity tree, YAML rewriting, recorder
  queries, HACS scanning, config-entry health. Do not add a command that
  duplicates a native API.

### The 24 commands

Read: `get_disabled_entities` (`state` = disabled|enabled|all), `export_states`,
`get_automations`, `get_template_sensors`, `get_entity_details`,
`get_config_entry_health`, `get_areas_and_floors`, `get_last_activity`
(optional `entity_ids`; recorder query), `list_hacs_items`,
`resolve_voice_target` (`phrase`; what the voice intents would make of it,
writing nothing), `get_voice_status` (sentence files, registered intents).

Write: `enable_entity`, `disable_entity`, `bulk_enable`, `bulk_disable`
(`entity_ids`, 1–500), `rename_entity` (`old_entity_id`, `new_entity_id`),
`update_entity_display_name` (`entity_id`, optional `name`; null clears),
`remove_entity`, `assign_entity_device`, `unassign_entity_device`,
`import_entity_states` (`entities`, 1–500), `update_yaml_references`
(`old_entity_id`, `new_entity_id`, `dry_run`), `register_template`,
`reinstall_voice_sentences` (optional `force`; overwrites an edited copy).

Only two HA services exist: `entity_manager.enable_entity` and
`entity_manager.disable_entity`. They share an admin gate in `__init__.py` that
mirrors `require_admin`; calls with no `context.user_id` (system-initiated) are
allowed. Everything else is WebSocket-only.

### Unusual bits

- Bulk ops go through `_bulk_toggle()`, which handles each entity individually
  and returns `{"success": [...], "failed": [...]}`. The panel depends on that
  split for accurate toasts and undo — do not collapse it to a boolean.
- `update_yaml_references` and `register_template` do regex text replacement over
  YAML config files, not semantic YAML parsing. They skip `secrets.yaml` and the
  dirs `custom_components`, `.storage`, `deps`, `tts`, `__pycache__`, `backups`, `snapshots`,
  `www`, `.git`, and write a `<file>.em-bak` beside every file they modify. Keep
  all three guards in any change to that path. Only `update_yaml_references`
  takes `dry_run`; `register_template` has no preview mode.
- `update_yaml_references` takes one `old_entity_id`/`new_entity_id` pair or a
  `renames` list (≤500). `_Rewriter` matches every entity-ID token in one regex
  pass and looks it up in the old→new table, so big batches stay linear and
  swaps cannot chain. Besides YAML it rewrites **storage-mode dashboards**
  (`async_load` / `async_save`), **config entry data/options**
  (`async_update_entry` — UI helpers keep their source entity there),
  **persons** (`device_trackers`), **Assist pipelines**
  (`async_update_pipeline`) and the **Energy dashboard preferences**
  (`async_get_manager` → `manager.async_update`, only the three keys
  `EnergyManager.async_update` merges) through HA's APIs — never by editing
  `.storage` on disk, which HA would overwrite from memory, so no HA stop is
  needed. Each gets
  a JSON backup under `.storage/entity_manager_backups/`. After a YAML write it
  reloads `automation`, `script`, `scene`, `template`. Integration Stores in
  `.storage` and files under `custom_components` are only **reported** in
  `manual_references` (`_STORAGE_REPORT_SKIP` filters registries, caches and
  credentials).
- `rename_entity` only touches the entity registry. The panel rewrites
  references itself via `_updateReferences()` after every rename path: the bulk
  rename queue (dry-run preview → renames → one update for the successes), the
  single-rename dialog (`_renameWithReferences`) and undo/redo of a rename.
  Before 3.2.0 no rename path wrote references at all.
- Bulk rename has **Import CSV / Export CSV** (`old_entity_id,new_entity_id,display_name`).
  Import is frontend-only: `_pickFile` → `_readImportText` → `_parseCsv` (quotes, BOM, `;` or `sep=`) →
  `_validateRenameCsv` → a summary dialog → rows land in the normal queue, so the
  reference preview and undo apply unchanged. Rows targeting an ID already in use
  are rejected, which rules out swaps and chains. Display names are set after the
  renames, through `update_entity_display_name`, with a `display_name_change` undo step.
- **Files in and out go through three helpers so they work in the Companion
  apps.** `_pickFile(onFile)` opens a file input with **no `accept` filter** —
  Android's picker greyed out a real CSV in OneDrive under `.csv,text/csv` — and
  keeps it in the page until the picker closes. `_readImportText(file)` refuses
  files over 5 MB, Excel workbooks and other binary files with a message, and
  reads non-UTF-8 text as Windows-1252 (Excel's plain "CSV" type).
  `_downloadFile(blob, name)` mirrors HA's own `fileDownload`: an attached
  `<a target=_blank download>`, and the blob URL is revoked after 10 s because
  the Android app fetches it asynchronously. Use these for any new import or
  export; do not create detached inputs or revoke a blob URL straight away.
- Bulk Rename's phone/tablet rules sit at the end of its CSS section. The width
  rules are **container queries** on `.em-bulk-rename-view` (`em-brv`: ≤900,
  ≤680, ≤480 px), because on a tablet the EM sidebar leaves the view
  phone-narrow while the viewport is not; touch sizing is `pointer: coarse`.
  The banner buttons use the `brv-banner-btn` classes, not inline styles, so
  those rules can reach them.
- A release bumps **four** places: `manifest.json`, `package.json` (+ lock, via
  `npm version`), the README badge, and `EM_VERSION` at the top of
  `entity-manager-panel.js` — the panel prints that constant in its header when
  the panel config carries no version. `check_docs.py` now fails on a stale one.
- The **Duplicate Names** card in Cleanup & Health finds entities whose displayed
  name repeats their device name — HA composes `<device> <entity>` when
  `has_entity_name` is set, and several integrations already put the device name
  in the entity name. Detection is frontend-only from
  `config/{entity,device}_registry/list`; matching is whole-word and
  accent-folded (`_nameWords` mirrors `_folded_form` in `voice_assistant.py`),
  because a substring test flags "Back" inside "Backpack". The fix **sets** the
  whole intended name (`<device> <remainder>`) via `update_entity_display_name`.
  Two HA rules make that the right shape: clearing the name falls back to the
  bad `original_name`, and a display name is used **verbatim** — HA prepends the
  device name only when no display name is set
  (`_async_get_full_entity_name_generic`), so setting just "power" would read as
  "Power" with the device lost. Entities whose own name *is* the
  device name, and devices carrying another device's name, are reported only.
  A third section compares each **integration entry title** with its device:
  HA titles an entry when the integration is first added and never revisits it,
  so 58 of 71 Shelly entries here still read the name their device had on setup
  day. Retitling goes through native `config_entries/update`, and only when the
  entry owns exactly one device — with several, the name is a judgement call.
- The **Voice** view (sidebar Actions and the stats-nav tile, both reaching
  `_openView('voice')` → `_renderVoiceView`) has four tabs, and
  the reason it exists is that HA's own UI does these badly or not at all.
  **Test a phrase** calls `resolve_voice_target` and writes nothing; it reports
  routing and resolution *separately*, because a name can resolve perfectly
  while the wording never reaches Entity Manager — "entity" is the word that
  routes. A miss lists the near misses with the share of spoken words they
  matched, against the 60% `_MIN_WORD_MATCH` bar. **Aliases** writes HA's
  registry `aliases` through native `config/entity_registry/update`; the
  suggestion comes from `_suggestVoiceAlias`, an Icelandic→English word table
  (`EntityManagerPanel.VOICE_WORDS`) over `_voiceFolded`, which mirrors
  `_folded_form` in `voice_assistant.py`. This is the practical fix for an
  English recogniser hearing "Skrifstofa" as "screen Store". **Status** shows
  the sentence file, the registered intents and every pipeline, warning when
  one cannot work — speech-to-phrase only transcribes sentences it was given in
  advance, so the wildcard slot can never be filled there. **Exposure**
  bulk-toggles `homeassistant/expose_entity`. Note the panel's older
  `em-entity-aliases` localStorage feature is a *display* nickname and has
  nothing to do with these; voice code is named `_voice*` to keep them apart.
- Frontend mutations call `_pushUndoAction({...})` to record reversible state
  *before* issuing the command. Undo/redo is 50 steps, persisted to
  `localStorage`. `remove_entity` is deliberately undo-exempt.
- All colour comes from `--em-*` CSS variables, never HA theme variables
  directly, so the theme engine can override light/dark correctly.
- **Header filter pills.** The Categories / Hardware / Areas / Labels counts in
  an integration or device header are buttons: clicking one filters that
  header's devices and entities. A header holds a *list* of filters — same kind
  OR'd, different kinds AND'd (`_pillMatchesAll`) — persisted per browser under
  `em-intg-pill-filters` and `em-device-pill-filters`, and validated on load so
  junk in storage cannot break the panel. Pills count entities everywhere,
  Hardware keeping its device count in the tooltip. With pills active the ⋯ menu
  can Select, Enable or Disable exactly what they show, and a banner above the
  list says how many are active, because a filter that outlives a reload must
  never look like missing data.
- **Renaming a device** (the Device button in Bulk Rename) writes only the
  device's `name_by_user` and puts its entity changes in the rename queue.
  Entity IDs carry references, and the queue already owns the dry-run preview,
  the reference update, per-entity failures and undo — a second path writing IDs
  directly is how the Energy dashboard broke before 3.4.0. It matches entity IDs
  against every name the device has had this session and, failing that, the
  prefix its IDs share, because a device renamed twice no longer matches its own
  entity IDs until the queue runs.
- Browser preferences and local display nicknames live under `em-*` `localStorage` keys, with three
  legacy camelCase holdouts (`em_undoStack`, `em_redoStack`,
  `em_lastActivityCache`). These are per-browser and never synced. Voice aliases and exposure settings
  are stored in HA and shared across browsers.

### Voice behaviour and verification limits

EM voice commands change the entity registry's enabled/disabled setting. They do
not turn a light on or off. In Assist, use "disable entity desk lamp" or
"enable entity desk lamp" with an admin user context. A voice satellite without
that context is refused. The shipped sentences are English.

Voice aliases use HA's entity-registry aliases, shared with its built-in Assist
agent. For normal commands such as "turn on desk lamp", the entity must also be
enabled and exposed to Assist. EM's registry commands can resolve disabled and
unexposed entities. Google exposure does not make EM's custom intents available
through Google Assistant.

The phrase tester checks EM wording and entity resolution only; it does not run
HA's built-in intents, speech recognition, or a complete Assist pipeline. Its
routing check recognises the literal openings in the shipped sentences; it is
not a full parser for arbitrary custom sentence syntax. Pipeline warnings flag
speech-to-phrase, missing speech-to-text and non-English language settings; they
do not verify that a chosen conversation agent will forward custom intents.

The 23 September live check added one registry alias and verified both EM
resolution and a built-in Assist state query immediately, without a restart or
conversation reload. It did not exercise spoken audio or switch a device.
The legacy browser-local display alias feature remains separate.
Exposure displays Assist and Google status; its bulk buttons update Assist only.
Suggested alias batches ask for confirmation with a count. Exposure changes
confirm the selected count, reject selections above 500, and block duplicate
submissions while pending. Failed writes keep the selection and do not create
an undo entry. Status explains the admin-user and satellite limitations.

## Tests and lint

Run from the repo root:

```
npm test                                                  # vitest run
npm run test:watch
npm run lint                                              # eslint .
npx eslint custom_components/entity_manager/frontend/     # what CI runs
ruff check custom_components/
ruff format --check custom_components/
mypy custom_components/entity_manager --ignore-missing-imports
node --check custom_components/entity_manager/frontend/entity-manager-panel.js
bandit -r custom_components/ --severity-level medium
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short                               # CI only — see below
```

- **`pytest` does not run on this machine.** Home Assistant does not support
  Windows: its own runner module imports `fcntl` and `resource`
  unconditionally, so collection dies before the first test, and stubbing those
  only gets as far as HA's event loop policy, which expects a Unix loop.
  DAVIDPC has Python 3.14 only, so use the Linux Python 3.12 CI job for this checkout's Python tests.
  A compatible Linux development environment can also run them. Run the local
  frontend, lint and type checks before pushing, then inspect the real Python
  CI result; the Python 3.11 and E2E jobs are placeholders.
- `pytest.ini` sets `asyncio_mode = auto`.
- Vitest uses jsdom with `testTransformMode: { ssr: ['**/*'] }` — without it the
  setup file's `node:fs` import is stubbed and every run fails with
  "fileURLToPath is not a function". Config in `vitest.config.js`, specs matched at
  `custom_components/entity_manager/frontend/tests/**/*.test.js`.
- CI is `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, on PRs and pushes to `main`, Python 3.12 with
  `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`. `ruff format --check` fails the build
  on formatting alone, so run ruff and mypy before pushing. The
  "Python Tests (3.11)" job is a deliberate no-op and the E2E job is a
  placeholder — no Playwright tests exist. The "frontend-tests" job only runs
  `node --check` on the panel; CI never runs the Vitest specs, so run `npm test`
  yourself.

## Deploy

```
.\deploy.ps1
.\deploy.ps1 -DryRun    # show what would change, write nothing
```

The checked-in wrapper is a thin wrapper over `E:\tools\deploy-to-ha.ps1`,
shared by every integration on this machine. No `sync-to-ha.ps1` script is in
the repo; a local gitignored helper with that name points at the same
underlying script for muscle memory and old permission lists. It copies
`custom_components\entity_manager` →
`Z:\custom_components\entity_manager` with `robocopy /E /R:2 /W:2` (`/E`,
never `/MIR`), excluding the dirs `__pycache__`, `.git`, `.Codex`, `.venv`,
`tests` and the files `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `test_*.py` plus local settings files.
Before copying it refuses to run unless `Z:\configuration.yaml` exists and
warns about anything on `Z:` that is newer than its `E:` counterpart (a hand
edit on the HA side about to be overwritten); afterwards it lists files on
`Z:` that the repo no longer has and fails if the deployed `manifest.json`
version does not match the source. Robocopy exit codes 0–7 are success (1 =
files copied); only ≥8 is a failure. The pre-2026-08-30 standalone script the
wrappers replaced is kept locally as sync-to-ha.ps1.bak-2026-08-30; it is
gitignored along with sync-to-ha.ps1 itself, so neither is in the repo.

- **Python changes need an HA restart; frontend-only changes need only a hard
  browser refresh.** Getting this backwards is the usual reason a change looks
  like it did not apply.
- `/E` never deletes, so a module you delete from the repo stays on `Z:`,
  still importable, until you remove it by hand — the deploy output names it.
  Never edit under `Z:\custom_components\entity_manager` directly; the next
  deploy overwrites it and the edit was never in git.
- `/R:2 /W:2` matters: robocopy's default is a million retries at 30 s, so a
  file HA holds open becomes a hang rather than an error. If the copy fails on a
  lock, restart HA and re-run.

## Gotchas

- The HACS release zip (`.github/workflows/release-asset.yml`) is built from
  the component directory and excludes `__pycache__`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`,
  every `tests/` folder (including `frontend/tests/`), `test_*.py` and
  `.Codex/`. Anything else in `custom_components/entity_manager/` ships to
  every user, so keep local tooling out of it.
- **There is no `Z:\AGENTS.md` any more.** Until 2026-09-10 a Jan–Feb 2026 copy
  of this repo's docs sat loose in the Home Assistant config root (AGENTS.md,
  README.md, INSTALL.md, STRUCTURE.md, PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, QUICKSTART.md,
  CHANGELOG.md, CHANGES.md, info.md, cursorrules.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md,
  eslint.config.js, sentences\). They were archived in
  `_from_Z/` (commit `20b0034`) and removed from the tree on 2026-09-18; git
  history still has them. If any of them reappear on `Z:`, something is copying
  the repo root instead of `custom_components\entity_manager`.
- The pre-2026-08-30 version of this file is in git history at commit
  `656230b`, not in the working tree. It contradicted itself on the version and
  documented wrong parameter names for `rename_entity`,
  `update_entity_display_name`, `get_last_activity` and `import_entity_states`.
  Do not reintroduce anything from it without checking source.
- Version bumps must touch both `manifest.json` and `package.json`.
- `VALID_ENTITY_ID` is stricter than it looks — the domain must start with a
  letter, not an underscore. Validate against it before any registry write.
- `remove_entity` is irreversible, and YAML-defined entities can return on the
  next HA restart.
- **Voice sentences only work from `<config>/custom_sentences/<lang>/`.** HA's
  conversation agent reads nowhere else and gives integrations no way to
  register their own, so `async_install_sentences` (in `voice_sentences.py`)
  copies the shipped file there on setup and calls `conversation.reload` when
  it changed. The Voice view's reinstall button runs the same code, and its
  `force` flag is the only thing that overwrites an edited copy. A copy whose first line
  is no longer `SENTENCE_MARKER` counts as user-edited and is never overwritten.
  The sentences use a **wildcard** slot, not HA's built-in `{name}` list: that
  list is built from exposed entities, and a disabled entity has no state, so it
  could never match the entities these intents exist for. `_resolve_entity_id`
  matches exact → substring → word by word (`_MIN_WORD_MATCH`, closest name
  wins), over name, original_name, object ID and **aliases**, each name scored
  separately. Verified on live HA 2026.9.3; a voice request with no user context
  is refused, so a Voice satellite cannot use these intents, and Google
  Assistant never reaches them at all — it maps exposed entities to traits and
  never consults the conversation agent.
- `strings.json` contains vestigial `options` strings; there is no options flow.
