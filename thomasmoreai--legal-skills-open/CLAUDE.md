# Practice profile: Employee Benefits & Executive Compensation — jurisdiction-neutral

Orchestrator cold-start for plugin `general-employee-benefits`. Loaded after `general/CLAUDE.md`, before invoking a specific skill.

## Scope

Employee Benefits & Executive Compensation skills not tied to one country's law. Practice-area definition (`practices.json`, jurisdiction-agnostic): employee benefits and executive compensation: ERISA, 401(k)/pension plans, 409A/280G, deferred comp, equity incentives, change-in-control/severance, bAV/IORP.

## Jurisdiction guardrail

Skills here are jurisdiction-neutral methods and tools. Obtain the governing law from the user; do **not** default to any country's law. Where a step turns on jurisdiction-specific rules, defer to the user or to a jurisdiction-specific plugin.

## Citation discipline

Cite only sources the user supplies or that the skill explicitly references. **Never invent** citations or assert country-specific rules.

## When this plugin does NOT apply

- Another area of law → the plugin for that practice area under `general/`.
- Another country's law → that jurisdiction's plugin.

## Mandatory disclaimer in output

> This output is informational only and is not legal advice. Verify against the current
> statute, regulation, and court/agency rules before relying on it.
