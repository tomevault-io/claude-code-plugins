## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/code-structure/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


Directory Logic: The top level of the app should include five major components organized by the three modes of interaction in AdaCAD: 

- Mixer: all of the components and services that are specific to and only used to render and manage the mixer component. 
- Editor: all of the components and services that are specific to and only used to render and manage the editor component. 
- Library: all of the components and services that are specific to and only used to render and manage the library component. 
- Viewer: all of the components and services that are specific to and only used to render and manage the viewer component. 
- Core: components and services that are accessed or used across multiple modes. 

All data structures and core computation should occur in adacad-drafting-lib. This library avoid classes and, instead, attempt to create objects that represent an immutable state of a given type.

Types: 
All types specific to the AdaCAD application should be defined in core/model/datatypes.ts. Aggressively create new types rather than passing objects with different variables. 

Streamlining Functions
Function that perform the same task should never be implemented in multiple places within the code. If you need a function that can be accessible in multiple locations, consider adding it in core/model/helper.ts or to the adacad-drafting-lib. If you need to create an object that somehow manages and makes state accessible across multiple components, add it as a service in core/model/provider/.  If you need a UI component in multiple places (e.g. the download menu), created it within core/ui.
