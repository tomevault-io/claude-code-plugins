## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/htn-planner/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

# Workspace housekeeping

- Store logs from manual or agent-run builds, tests and diagnostics in
  `build/logs/`, creating the directory before redirecting output.
- Use descriptive filenames within that directory, such as
  `build/logs/recursion-debug-tests.log`. Resolve the path relative to the
  repository root even when running a command from a project subdirectory.
- Keep the existing SDK validation scripts' logs in their dedicated build
  directories. Those scripts manage their own output locations.
- When documenting a local validation run, reference its actual log path.
