# vg-porting-source

> Porting external samples into Visual Gasic — copy source structure, do not rewrite

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/vg-porting-source/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:


# Porting = transliteration

When the user asks to **port** BASIC-256 (`.kbs`), QB64, or other reference programs into `.vg`:

1. **Copy structure from the source** — same `graphsize`/dimensions, variable names, loop bounds, subroutine names, and algorithm order. Only replace API shims (e.g. `refresh` → `_Display`, `graphsize` → `_NewImage` + `Screen`, `text`/`font` → `_TextAt` + `_TextHeight`).
2. **Do not rewrite** as a “lite” 320×200 SCREEN 13 demo unless the user explicitly asks for a reduced version.
3. **Credit** the upstream author in the file header and in `docs/showcase/` when applicable.
4. If a VG API is missing for faithful ports, **extend the engine** (see `vg-no-workarounds.mdc`) rather than approximating behavior in game code.
