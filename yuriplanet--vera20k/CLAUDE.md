# VERA20k — Project contract

VERA20k is a cross-platform Rust reimplementation of the Command & Conquer:
Yuri's Revenge engine (`gamemd.exe`), using original retail rules and assets.
The goal is to reproduce native gameplay behavior through a Rust-native architecture,
while scaling to **20,000 units and 30 players**. VERA20k must build and run on Linux,
macOS and Windows; keep architecture and dependencies compatible.

All simulation-affecting math must produce identical results across supported
platforms and CPU architectures for identical state, inputs and RNG. Prefer
`SimFixed` for simulation calculations; document and validate any differences
from native precision and rounding.

Development follows complete gameplay mechanisms and their required dependencies,
with clear ownership of state and shared logic. Native executable behavior and
retail data establish what the implementation must reproduce.

This contract governs Codex and Claude. Use engineering judgment; skills are optional
specialized help. Specific user instructions override workflow defaults.

## Intent and autonomy

The user often thinks aloud. Follow intent, keep exact technical values literal,
and treat proposed causes as hypotheses. Investigate contradictory observations.
Push back briefly with evidence; respect informed decisions.

Complete authorized work without routine approval. Resolve discoverable questions;
ask only for missing authority or consequential, undiscoverable preferences.
Research/review alone does not authorize implementation. Preserve scope amendments
and stop instructions across continuations.

Be brief, plain and result-first.

## Exactness and evidence

Confirm gamemd-derived changes against original instructions, active callers, and
retail data. Ghidra annotations are often wrong; treat them as
leads, not proof. Confirm active-YR reachability; unreachable claims need a breakpoint or
flag-to-leaf trace. Never invent offsets, identities or behavior.

Priority follows player visibility and frequency; it does not establish equivalence.
Differences a player cannot see, such as 1–2 px offsets or small color deltas, get a
one-line residual, not investigation; when a visual detail matters, port the drawing
code instead of fitting captures.
Missing or unproven required behavior keeps an exhaustive task open.

Distinguish and cite:

- **Native behavior established:** body/caller/data evidence.
- **Rust regression tested:** named implementation checks.
- **Parity demonstrated:** gamemd-derived executable comparison or exhaustive proof,
  bounded by stated coverage. A sample cannot certify the whole mechanism.

Parity goldens come from native execution/emulation, capture or retail bytes,
not hand calculations or prior Rust; inputs a comparison takes from VERA need
their own native evidence. Avoid unqualified “VERIFIED”/“complete”.

Arithmetic, rounding, RNG draws (count, order, stream) and timer cadences derived from
reading are uncertain until executed. Before merging a mechanism, compare them against
native execution ([Unicorn](tools/native_oracle.md) or capture) and pin the results as
golden values in its Rust tests. Control flow and ordering may rest on instruction-level
reading. Each PR states the evidence level each claim reached.

Preserve native comparisons as reproducible harnesses and results, recording binary
identity and coverage limits. Link them to Rust tests where practical; parity claims
must cite saved evidence and actual validation results.

Each cohesive gamemd-derived Rust behavior carries nearby native identity/address
and source; sim-behavior commits cite their evidence.
Consult the [Ghidra reference](docs/research/ghidra-workflow.md) for access,
interpretation pitfalls and shared-database edits.

## Retail data

gamemd behavior is native code plus the INI keys it reads; port both. For each key,
port the native read: file and layer, section, exact-case key, default, parser, clamps,
read order and any post-read pass. Defaults come from the constructor or the reader's
default argument, never from retail values. Take type names and tuning values from the
keys gamemd reads; hard-code a name only where gamemd holds the literal. Parse with the
native readers in `src/rules/ini_value.rs`, not `str::parse`.

Read retail values in every applicable layer before choosing constants, priorities or
fixtures. Each scenario re-reads rules from `RULESMD.INI`, `LANGRULE.INI` when present,
the selected mode INI, then the map (campaigns and one mode add passes); the map also
extends `AIMD.INI`. `ARTMD.INI` and the sound, EVA and theme INIs are not layered, and
gamemd never reads the RA2 base INIs in `ini/`. A branch gated on a key the retail rules
leave unset is dormant, not unreachable. Check retail data with a gamemd-exact parse,
not grep. When INI values decide an outcome, test through the production reader on
retail INIs. Details: [retail INI reference](src/rules/mod.rs).

## Architecture and delivery

Use the simplest implementation that fully satisfies the required behavior. Avoid
unnecessary abstractions, duplicated logic and speculative features; prefer clarity
over minimizing line count.

Prefer data-oriented design for simulation hot loops: organize data for efficient access and batch processing, minimize unnecessary per-entity work. Match gamemd's results, not its execution strategy: batch, vectorize or parallelize freely when the outcome is identical to native order; keep RNG draws and same-frame cross-object effects in native sequence.

Choose boundaries and abstractions by responsibility and consumers, not line/type
counts or C++ structure. Preserve state authority, lifecycle, scheduler/RNG order,
timers, same-tick effects, persistence and numeric semantics under the policy below.
Document and validate floating-point use where native behavior requires it.
Storage order and active-object order are distinct.

All math must preserve simulation determinism across supported platforms and CPU
architectures for identical state, inputs and RNG. Prefer `SimFixed` for simulation
math, accepting documented differences from native precision and rounding. Avoid
x87 emulation unless demonstrated gameplay requirements make it necessary; exact
native arithmetic alone is not a requirement to emulate x87. Validate affected
gameplay, range and overflow behavior. Presentation must not affect simulation
determinism.

`sim/` never depends on `render/`, `ui/`, `sidebar/`, `audio/` or `net/`.
App code orchestrates without owning duplicate gameplay. Current module contracts
and `advance_tick` phases describe the architecture. Name coordinate frames/units.

VERA20k contains duplicate state, functions and call chains from incomplete migrations.
Trace their use before changes. Untangle affected ownership, consolidate duplicates,
finish required migrations and remove obsolete code/state. Preserve intentional
differences, validate affected paths and keep cleanup within task scope.

Fix refactoring in the code your change touches. File a GitHub issue labeled `refactor`
only for what would change behavior outside your chain or is too big for the change;
add `tooling` when it concerns tools, test infrastructure, CI or workflow. Search open
issues first and comment on a match instead of filing a duplicate. Say where it is, why
it hurts and what work it slowed down, not how to fix it, and comment again each time
it slows work down. Issues are leads: verify them before acting, and correct or close
any that prove wrong. Pick refactoring work by that recorded cost. When your PR fixes or
changes what an open issue says, close or correct it in that PR.

Simulation state and shared decisions have one authoritative owner. Before adding
state or decision logic, find existing writers and name the owner in the PR. Extend
or fix that owner instead of introducing competing state or duplicated decision
logic. Keep authoritative state private to its owning module and expose mutations
through the owner. Never widen visibility to reach another owner's state or raw data;
extend the owner instead. CI fails a change that raises the number of `src/sim`
struct fields any simulation module can write (`pub`, `pub(crate)` and equivalents);
check with `python tools/sim_field_ratchet.py --base origin/main`.

Before porting a native function, search the code for its address (e.g. `703850`) and
native name. Each native function has one Rust port; new callers call it instead of
adding a wrapper or re-inlining its body. Never fork an owner: when an existing one is
wrong for your chain, correct it for every caller (a change toward native is in scope,
with evidence for each affected path) or use it as it is and record the residual. A
change that adds a copy, a caller-specific wrapper or a competing owner is a defect to
remove before merge; the critic checks for them.

Derived caches and indexes are allowed when their source of truth, update or
invalidation rules, and consistency validation are explicit.

One owner follows a complete mechanism through evidence, implementation, production
integration and review. Consider the surrounding architecture and affected consumers,
and use integration evidence appropriate to the change, including runtime reproduction
when needed. Reassess worsening fixes.
Design/plan artifacts are optional; implementation authority includes design choices.

Work one complete chain at a time: a player-visible mechanism traced through its
native call chains from trigger through prerequisites, admission, effects, downstream
consumers and cleanup, across class and subsystem boundaries. Bound each chain to one
common path (unit, weapon or screen route) so it stays reviewable; other paths are
later chains. Pick the next chain by player visibility and frequency. Research may
range wider; implementation stays on the current chain. In the same change, migrate
affected consumers, delete superseded paths, and remove duplicates and dead code in
the code the chain touches. Shared dependencies still used by other mechanisms remain
with their existing owner.

Record the RNG draws, timer writes and detach calls the chain passes in its residuals
or ledger row, even when they are not ported. Behavior invented where a native body
exists is a recorded residual with a reason, never a silent default.

Follow native dependencies across subsystem and class boundaries wherever the selected
behavior requires them. Newly discovered prerequisite state, lifecycle transitions and
call chains are in scope. Establish their initialization, updates, ordering and cleanup
through the proper owners, and revise the implementation plan when evidence demands it.
Fix missing or wrong prerequisites in the same change; leave a residual only for a large
separate mechanism, and tell the user.
Preserve explicit user exclusions and stop instructions; record unrelated findings as
follow-ups.

One chain is one PR: don't split a chain into several PRs or open one per gap, and
don't stack unmerged implementation branches (researching ahead is fine).
Residuals name trigger, effect, frequency and downstream risk; deferring required loop or
determinism/authority/lifecycle work cannot close that loop.

Delegate independent work with clear ownership. For substantial/risky changes, run
one fresh read-only [critic](.agents/skills/_shared/review.md) after implementation
and validation, before opening the PR. The critic is free to inspect original evidence
and challenge scope/design. It identifies implementation defects and useful refactoring
opportunities, explaining their impact and risks. The owner fixes confirmed defects,
rejects false positives with evidence and may implement worthwhile in-scope refactors,
validating all changes. Unrelated opportunities become `refactor` issues. Each validated,
dependency-coherent mechanism gets its own PR and its own single critic pass; do not
hold validated mechanisms back to batch them into one review. Do not run critics per
implementation increment within a mechanism or repeat reviews after fixes or revisions
unless the user explicitly asks.
Keep a concise [checkpoint](.agents/skills/_shared/handoff.md) for sustained work.

## Git and validation

Check actual Git/worktree/process state before mutating. Never alter another task's
files, refs or processes; untouched-file failures require causal investigation.

Start `feature/<topic>` from fetched `origin/main`; isolate owned/dirty checkouts.
Continue task-owned branches and commit validated increments. Never commit/push
directly to `main`. Publication requires user/goal authority; PRs target `main`.
Integrate promptly when authorized. Owners resolve conflicts and revalidate.
Preserve unique/local data; use `sync` for complex cleanup.

Choose validation appropriate to the change, considering native fidelity, connected
production behavior and protection against regressions.

Avoid tests that merely mirror the implementation or require maintaining a second implementation of the same logic.
Before fixing a bug whose expected behavior is established, first make a focused test fail on it where practical.

- Working Rust: `cargo check -p vera20k` as needed; focused
  `cargo test -p vera20k --lib <module_path>::`.
- Rust PR readiness: one full `cargo test -p vera20k --lib` plus
  `cargo clippy -p vera20k --lib` on the final candidate with retail `ini/` and
  `VERA20K_REQUIRE_RETAIL_INI=1`; no baseline runs. Validate later fixes with
  focused tests; repeat both only when a fix reaches beyond the tested modules or
  a `main` merge conflicts. Cross-platform Clippy, Python tooling and lib-test
  workflows (without retail INIs) are maintainer-dispatched and are not merge
  requirements. The quick simulation field ratchet remains automatic and required.
  Agents run the local checks above; do not dispatch or wait for the manual
  platform workflows unless the user asks.
- Asset binding, loader or rules-closure changes: a release-build retail map load
  before merge; the lib suite never runs the app loader against retail assets.
- Docs/skills: validate content, links/examples and tooling; no Cargo suite.
- Every `cargo test` uses `--lib`.

Run Cargo through `python -m tools.cargo_run -- <cargo arguments>` from the checkout.
It waits for other builds and serializes cooperating worktrees; do not compete with or
kill a compile. Each run blocks every other session's Cargo until it finishes, so
batch edits and run the narrowest command that answers your question.
Default to unlabelled builds; label only active comparison, capture or debugging binaries.
Prefer release captures and retain debug tests selectively. Reference hashes, manifests
and results without extra executable copies. After each merge, dry-run retirement of
superseded owned labels, preserving required binaries, dependencies and evidence.
Resolve unmet minimum free space before another large build; follow the
[retention procedure](tools/README.md#cargo-ownership-and-labeled-builds). Confirm fresh-worktree config/assets.
Format edited leaf files only (`rustfmt --edition 2024 <file>`), never crate-wide
or recursive `mod.rs`. Coordinate snapshot versions/rebaselines; exclude others' WIP.

Don't poll: each check re-reads the whole session context. `cargo_run` already waits
for other builds, so run no separate process checks. Wait for a long command or CI
through one blocking call or the host's completion notice, not `sleep`/`until` loops
or repeated status queries. When merging is authorized, enable auto-merge on the
validated PR (`gh pr merge <number> --auto --merge`) and move on; GitHub merges it
once every required check passes. Confirm it merged before publishing your next PR.

## Knowledge and guidance

Keep current contracts, focused implementation rationale and reproducible native
evidence close to their code or tools. Historical investigations live in the
[research archive](docs/research/README.md); consult them explicitly when useful,
recheck their claims, and update the current owner rather than maintaining chains
of superseded reports. Retention or an index status is not proof of correctness.

Internet documentation lookup is allowed without routine approval. Resolve uncertain
technical behavior using authoritative references, specifications and upstream source;
match library/API documentation to the version in use. Graphics work requires both
API knowledge (e.g. wgpu) and rendering principles: visibility/depth, blending,
color/palette math, projection/sampling, GPU execution and performance. Cite
consequential findings near the implementation or review. Validate affected production
output and performance with appropriate captures, GPU readbacks or profiling;
documentation and CPU-only tests alone do not establish rendered gamemd parity.
For Rust style beyond this contract, consult the
[condensed Rust guidelines](.agents/skills/_shared/rust-guidelines.md) when shaping
APIs, hot loops, error handling or tests; this contract wins on conflict.

Resolve `<main-checkout>` with `git worktree list`; its `ini/`, config and `LOCAL.md`
are machine-local. Use `asset`/`asset-browser`; a successful parse or plausible
render is not correctness proof.

Tools follow the same one-owner rule as code. Before writing a helper, look for an
existing tool in `tools/` and `src/bin/`, and extend it instead of copying it. Put
anything another session would need in the repo, not a scratchpad; one-off
investigation scripts can stay in scratch.

Check compatibility before dependency changes; document non-obvious decisions near
their owner. Edit skills in `.agents/skills/`; generate Claude copies with
`python tools/skill_sync.py --write`, verify with `--check`. Keep conditional detail
where needed; remove superseded rules.

When changing the shared project contract, update both `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

## Codex notes

Use Codex task tools for cross-session context; verify current source/Git before
treating past conclusions as current. Load only relevant skills and references.
